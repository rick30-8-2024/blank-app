Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024[update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.[3] Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[4] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these.[5][4][6] His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Early life and education Childhood and family See also: Family of Elon Musk Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[7][8] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][21] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines.\"[22][23] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[20][24][25][26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school (\"veldskool\") that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[9][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[29] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[30] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless\".[30] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[31] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[30][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][32] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[34][35] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38] Business career Elon Musk has started a number of businesses since 1995, with initial business success and liquidity gained from sales of equity in one business providing the capital for him to start subsequent business enterprises. Musk is widely considered a serial entrepreneur. By the 2020s, several Musk businesses had formed strategic partnerships with some employees playing roles simultaneously in more than one of Musk's companies.[56][57] Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[58][59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period was described by Musk as a \"gray area\".[62][63] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[64] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[65] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[66][67] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[68] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia In March 1999,[69] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[70] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[71] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[69] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[72] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][72][73] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[74] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[75] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[76][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[78][79] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[80][81] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[82][83] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[84] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[85] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[86] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[86] With $100 million of his own money,[87] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[88][89] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[90] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA.[91][92] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[90] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[93] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[94] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[95] Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014 Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[96] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[97] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[98][99] Since 2019,[100] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[101] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[102] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[103] Starlink This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(October 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[104] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[105] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[106][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[109][110][111] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[112] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[113] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[114][115][116] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[117][118] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[119][120][121] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011 Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[126][page needed][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[129][130] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[131] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[132] Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[133] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[134] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[135] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[136] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[137][138] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any kind,[139] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[140] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[141] and delivered in November 2023.[142] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[143] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[144] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[145][146] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[147][148] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[149] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[150] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[150] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[151] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[152] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[153] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[154] SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[155][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[155][159][160] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[161] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[162] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[163] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[164][165] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[166] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[167] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[168] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[169][170] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[171] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[172] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[173] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[174] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[175][176] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[177] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[178][179] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[180][181] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[182] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[183][184] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[184][185] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[186] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[183] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[187] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[188] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[189][190][191] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[189] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[186] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[192] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[193] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[194] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[195] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[196][197] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[198] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[199] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[200][201] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[202] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[203] Twitter / X Further information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022[204] Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[205] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[206][207] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[208] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[209] making him the largest shareholder.[210][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[212] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[213][214] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[210][215] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[216] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[217] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[218][219] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[220][221] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[222] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[223] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[224] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[225] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[226] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[227] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[228] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[228][229] Musk became the CEO instead.[230] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[231][232][233] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[234][235] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[236][237] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[238] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[239][240] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[241] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[245][246] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[247] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[248] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan.\"[249] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals.\"[250] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[251] Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[252] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[253] Musk does not make formal business plans.[253] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[254] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[252][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[255][256][257] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[258] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[259][257] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[257] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[260] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[261] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[252] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[257][262] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[263] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[264] Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276] Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[282] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[283] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[284] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[285] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[286] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[287][288] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision\".[289] OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI (company) In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[290] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[291] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[292] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[293] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[294] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[295] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[296] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[297] Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[298] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[299] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[300][301] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[298][302] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[303] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[304] He then deleted the tweets,[304] apologized,[305] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[306] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[307][308] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[309][310][311] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[312][313] 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[314] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[315] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[316] Music In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[317][318] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[319] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[320] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[321] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[320] Private jet Main articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[322][323] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[322][324] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[325][326][327] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[328] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[329] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[330] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[331] Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[332][333] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal.[334] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[334] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[334] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[335] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[332] Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[336] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[337] Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[338][339] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[340] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[341] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[342] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[343][344] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[345] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[346] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[347] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[348][349] Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[350][351] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[352] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[353] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[354][355][356][357][358] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[359] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[360][361] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[362] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[363][364] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[365] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[366] Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[367] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[368] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[369] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[370] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[371][372] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[373][374][375] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[374][376][375] Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[377] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[378][379] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[380][381] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[382] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[383][384] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[385] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[386] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[387] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[388][389] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[390] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[391] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[392][393] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[394] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[395][396] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[397] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[398] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[399] He later denied the claim.[400] Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 (left), and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 (right) Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[401][402][403][404][405] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[406] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[407][408][409] and numerous conspiracy theories.[410][411] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[412] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[413] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest;[414] however, beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[415] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[416] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[417] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[418] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[419] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[420][421] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections.[422][423] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[424] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[424] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[425][426][427] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[428] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[429] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[430] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[431] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[432] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[432] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[433] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[433] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[434] That same month, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[435][436] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[437] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[438] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[439][440] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[441] and Elizabeth Warren.[442] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[443][444][better source needed] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[445] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[446] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[447] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[448]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[449][450] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[451][452][453] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[454][455] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[456][457][458] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[459][460][461][462] Musk with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023 In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[463] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[464] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and described it as \"jarring.\"[465] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying \"Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"[466] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable\". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[467][468][469][470] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"[471][472] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[473][474] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[475] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[476] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America’s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[477][478] Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[479] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[480] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces\".[481][482] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied \"You have said the actual truth.\"[481][482] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[483] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".[484] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[485] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[486][487] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[488][489] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[490] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[491][492] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[493] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done.\"[494][495] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[496] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[497] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour.\"[498] COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[499][500] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[501] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[502][503] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[499] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[500] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[504] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[505][506] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[499][507][508] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[509][510] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[510] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[511][512] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[513] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[514] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[513] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[515][516] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[517][518] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[519] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[519][520] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[521] Personal life In 2002, Musk became a U.S. citizen.[522] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[523] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[523][524][525] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[526][527] During a South African safari in late 2000, he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California.[528] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[529] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[530][531] Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression,[532] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[533][534][535] Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[2] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[536] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[537] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[538] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[538] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[539][540] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[541] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[541] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[542][543] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son [sic], essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son [sic] is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[544] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic”, whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[545] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[546] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[547][548] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[549] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[549] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[550] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[551] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[552] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[553] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[554][555] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[556][557] which they then changed to \"“X Æ A-Xii”.[558][559] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[560] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[1] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[561][562] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[1] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[563] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[564] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[565][566][567] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[568] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[569] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[570][2] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[571] Musk denied the report.[572] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend.\"[573] Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[574] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[575][576] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[577] and Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[578] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[579] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[579] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[580][581] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[582] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[583][584][585] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[583] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[583][584][586] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[587] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[588][589] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[590][591][592] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[590][592] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[593] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[594] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[595] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, though much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[596] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies.\"[597] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[598] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[599] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[600][601][602] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[603] Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk (right) and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[604] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[605] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[606] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[607] Why Him? (2016),[608] and Men in Black: International (2019).[609] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[610] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[611] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[612][613] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[614] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[615][616] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[617] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[618][619] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[620] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[621] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[622] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[623] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[624] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[625] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[626] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[627] 2013,[628] 2018,[629] and 2021.[630] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[631][632] Notes and references Notes ^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[77][78] ^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[107][108] ^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[156] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[157][158] ^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[211] Citations ^ a b c Gordon, Devin (March 10, 2022). \"\"Infamy Is Kind Of Fun\": Grimes on Music, Mars, and—Surprise!—Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\".

LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp. 6, 8, 10. \"There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in Pretoria, there was a boy who wanted to be a man.\" (p. 10.)

Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024[update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.[3] Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[4] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these.[5][4][6] His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Early life and education Childhood and family See also: Family of Elon Musk Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[7][8] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][21] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines.\"[22][23] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[20][24][25][26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school (\"veldskool\") that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[9][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[29] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[30] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless\".[30] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[31] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[30][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][32] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[34][35] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38] Business career Elon Musk has started a number of businesses since 1995, with initial business success and liquidity gained from sales of equity in one business providing the capital for him to start subsequent business enterprises. Musk is widely considered a serial entrepreneur. By the 2020s, several Musk businesses had formed strategic partnerships with some employees playing roles simultaneously in more than one of Musk's companies.[56][57] Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[58][59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period was described by Musk as a \"gray area\".[62][63] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[64] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[65] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[66][67] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[68] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia In March 1999,[69] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[70] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[71] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[69] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[72] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][72][73] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[74] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[75] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[76][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[78][79] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[80][81] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[82][83] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[84] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[85] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[86] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[86] With $100 million of his own money,[87] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[88][89] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[90] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA.[91][92] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[90] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[93] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[94] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[95] Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014 Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[96] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[97] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[98][99] Since 2019,[100] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[101] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[102] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[103] Starlink This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help improve it by rewriting it in a balanced fashion that contextualizes different points of view. (October 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[104] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[105] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[106][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[109][110][111] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[112] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[113] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[114][115][116] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[117][118] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[119][120][121] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011 Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[126][page needed][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[129][130] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[131] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[132] Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[133] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[134] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[135] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[136] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[137][138] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any kind,[139] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[140] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[141] and delivered in November 2023.[142] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[143] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[144] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[145][146] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[147][148] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[149] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[150] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[150] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[151] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[152] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[153] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[154] SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[155][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[155][159][160] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[161] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[162] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[163] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[164][165] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[166] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[167] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[168] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[169][170] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[171] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[172] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[173] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[174] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[175][176] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[177] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[178][179] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[180][181] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[182] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[183][184] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[184][185] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[186] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[183] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[187] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[188] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[189][190][191] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[189] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[186] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[192] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[193] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[194] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[195] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[196][197] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[198] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[199] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[200][201] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[202] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[203] Twitter / X Further information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022[204] Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[205] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[206][207] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[208] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[209] making him the largest shareholder.[210][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[212] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[213][214] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[210][215] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[216] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[217] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[218][219] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[220][221] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[222] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[223] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[224] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[225] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[226] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[227] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[228] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[228][229] Musk became the CEO instead.[230] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[231][232][233] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[234][235] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[236][237] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[238] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[239][240] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[241] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[245][246] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[247] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[248] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan.\"[249] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals.\"[250] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[251] Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[252] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[253] Musk does not make formal business plans.[253] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[254] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[252][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[255][256][257] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[258] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[259][257] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[257] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[260] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[261] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[252] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[257][262] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[263] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[264] Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276] Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[282] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[283] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[284] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[285] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[286] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[287][288] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision\".[289] OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI (company) In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[290] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[291] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[292] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[293] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[294] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[295] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[296] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[297] Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[298] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[299] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[300][301] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[298][302] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[303] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[304] He then deleted the tweets,[304] apologized,[305] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[306] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[307][308] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[309][310][311] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[312][313] 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[314] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[315] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[316] Music In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[317][318] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[319] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[320] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[321] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[320] Private jet Main articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[322][323] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[322][324] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[325][326][327] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[328] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[329] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[330] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[331] Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[332][333] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal.[334] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[334] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[334] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[335] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[332] Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[336] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[337] Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[338][339] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[340] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[341] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[342] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[343][344] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[345] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[346] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[347] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[348][349] Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[350][351] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[352] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[353] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[354][355][356][357][358] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[359] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[360][361] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[362] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[363][364] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[365] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[366] Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[367] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[368] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[369] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[370] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[371][372] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[373][374][375] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[374][376][375] Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[377] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[378][379] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[380][381] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[382] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[383][384] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[385] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[386] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[387] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[388][389] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[390] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[391] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[392][393] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[394] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[395][396] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[397] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[398] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[399] He later denied the claim.[400] Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 (left), and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 (right) Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[401][402][403][404][405] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[406] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[407][408][409] and numerous conspiracy theories.[410][411] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[412] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[413] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest;[414] however, beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[415] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[416] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[417] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[418] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[419] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[420][421] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections.[422][423] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[424] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[424] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[425][426][427] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[428] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[429] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[430] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[431] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[432] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[432] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[433] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[433] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[434] That same month, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[435][436] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[437] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[438] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[439][440] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[441] and Elizabeth Warren.[442] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[443][444][better source needed] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[445] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[446] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[447] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[448]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[449][450] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[451][452][453] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[454][455] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[456][457][458] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[459][460][461][462] Musk with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023 In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[463] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[464] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and described it as \"jarring.\"[465] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying \"Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"[466] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable\". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[467][468][469][470] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"[471][472] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[473][474] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[475] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[476] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America’s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[477][478] Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[479] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[480] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces\".[481][482] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied \"You have said the actual truth.\"[481][482] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[483] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".[484] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[485] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[486][487] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[488][489] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[490] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[491][492] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[493] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done.\"[494][495] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[496] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[497] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour.\"[498] COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[499][500] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[501] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[502][503] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[499] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[500] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[504] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[505][506] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[499][507][508] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[509][510] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[510] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[511][512] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[513] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[514] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[513] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[515][516] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[517][518] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[519] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[519][520] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[521] Personal life In 2002, Musk became a U.S. citizen.[522] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[523] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[523][524][525] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[526][527] During a South African safari in late 2000, he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California.[528] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[529] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[530][531] Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression,[532] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[533][534][535] Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[2] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[536] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[537] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[538] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[538] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[539][540] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[541] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[541] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[542][543] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son [sic], essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son [sic] is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[544] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic”, whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[545] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[546] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[547][548] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[549] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[549] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[550] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[551] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[552] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[553] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[554][555] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[556][557] which they then changed to \"“X Æ A-Xii”.[558][559] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[560] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[1] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[561][562] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[1] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[563] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[564] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[565][566][567] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[568] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[569] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[570][2] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[571] Musk denied the report.[572] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend.\"[573] Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[574] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[575][576] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[577] and Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[578] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[579] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[579] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[580][581] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[582] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[583][584][585] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[583] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[583][584][586] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[587] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[588][589] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[590][591][592] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[590][592] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[593] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[594] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[595] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, though much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[596] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies.\"[597] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[598] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[599] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[600][601][602] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[603] Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk (right) and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[604] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[605] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[606] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[607] Why Him? (2016),[608] and Men in Black: International (2019).[609] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[610] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[611] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[612][613] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[614] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[615][616] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[617] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[618][619] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[620] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[621] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[622] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[623] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[624] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[625] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[626] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[627] 2013,[628] 2018,[629] and 2021.[630] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[631][632] Notes and references Notes ^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[77][78] ^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[107][108] ^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[156] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[157][158] ^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[211] Citations ^ a b c Gordon, Devin (March 10, 2022). \"\"Infamy Is Kind Of Fun\": Grimes on Music, Mars, and—Surprise!—Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\".

Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024[update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.[3] Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[4] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these.[5][4][6] His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Early life and education Childhood and family See also: Family of Elon Musk Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[7][8] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][21] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines.\"[22][23] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[20][24][25][26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school (\"veldskool\") that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[9][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[29] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[30] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless\".[30] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[31] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[30][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][32] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[34][35] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38] Business career Elon Musk has started a number of businesses since 1995, with initial business success and liquidity gained from sales of equity in one business providing the capital for him to start subsequent business enterprises. Musk is widely considered a serial entrepreneur. By the 2020s, several Musk businesses had formed strategic partnerships with some employees playing roles simultaneously in more than one of Musk's companies.[56][57] Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[58][59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period was described by Musk as a \"gray area\".[62][63] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[64] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[65] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[66][67] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[68] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia In March 1999,[69] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[70] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[71] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[69] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[72] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][72][73] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[74] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[75] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[76][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[78][79] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[80][81] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[82][83] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[84] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[85] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[86] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[86] With $100 million of his own money,[87] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[88][89] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[90] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA.[91][92] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[90] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[93] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[94] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[95] Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014 Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[96] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[97] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[98][99] Since 2019,[100] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[101] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[102] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[103] Starlink This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(October 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[104] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[105] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[106][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[109][110][111] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[112] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[113] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[114][115][116] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[117][118] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[119][120][121] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011 Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[126][page needed][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[129][130] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[131] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[132] Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[133] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[134] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[135] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[136] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[137][138] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any kind,[139] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[140] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[141] and delivered in November 2023.[142] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[143] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[144] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[145][146] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[147][148] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[149] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[150] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[150] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[151] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[152] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[153] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[154] SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[155][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[155][159][160] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[161] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[162] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[163] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[164][165] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[166] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[167] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[168] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[169][170] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[171] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[172] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[173] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[174] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[175][176] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[177] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[178][179] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[180][181] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[182] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[183][184] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[184][185] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[186] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[183] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[187] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[188] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[189][190][191] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[189] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[186] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[192] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[193] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[194] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[195] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[196][197] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[198] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[199] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[200][201] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[202] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[203] Twitter / X Further information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022[204] Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[205] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[206][207] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[208] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[209] making him the largest shareholder.[210][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[212] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[213][214] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[210][215] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[216] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[217] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[218][219] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[220][221] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[222] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[223] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[224] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[225] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[226] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[227] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[228] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[228][229] Musk became the CEO instead.[230] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[231][232][233] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[234][235] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[236][237] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[238] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[239][240] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[241] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[245][246] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[247] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[248] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan.\"[249] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals.\"[250] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[251] Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[252] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[253] Musk does not make formal business plans.[253] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[254] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[252][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[255][256][257] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[258] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[259][257] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[257] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[260] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[261] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[252] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[257][262] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[263] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[264] Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276] Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[282] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[283] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[284] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[285] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[286] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[287][288] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision\".[289] OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI (company) In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[290] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[291] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[292] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[293] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[294] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[295] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[296] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[297] Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[298] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[299] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[300][301] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[298][302] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[303] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[304] He then deleted the tweets,[304] apologized,[305] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[306] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[307][308] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[309][310][311] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[312][313] 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[314] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[315] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[316] Music In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[317][318] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[319] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[320] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[321] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[320] Private jet Main articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[322][323] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[322][324] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[325][326][327] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[328] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[329] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[330] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[331] Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[332][333] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal.[334] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[334] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[334] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[335] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[332] Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[336] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[337] Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[338][339] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[340] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[341] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[342] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[343][344] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[345] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[346] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[347] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[348][349] Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[350][351] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[352] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[353] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[354][355][356][357][358] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[359] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[360][361] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[362] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[363][364] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[365] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[366] Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[367] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[368] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[369] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[370] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[371][372] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[373][374][375] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[374][376][375] Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[377] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[378][379] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[380][381] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[382] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[383][384] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[385] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[386] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[387] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[388][389] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[390] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[391] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[392][393] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[394] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[395][396] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[397] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[398] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[399] He later denied the claim.[400] Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 (left), and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 (right) Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[401][402][403][404][405] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[406] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[407][408][409] and numerous conspiracy theories.[410][411] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[412] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[413] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest;[414] however, beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[415] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[416] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[417] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[418] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[419] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[420][421] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections.[422][423] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[424] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[424] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[425][426][427] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[428] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[429] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[430] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[431] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[432] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[432] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[433] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[433] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[434] That same month, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[435][436] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[437] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[438] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[439][440] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[441] and Elizabeth Warren.[442] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[443][444][better source needed] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[445] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[446] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[447] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[448]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[449][450] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[451][452][453] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[454][455] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[456][457][458] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[459][460][461][462] Musk with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023 In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[463] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[464] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and described it as \"jarring.\"[465] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying \"Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"[466] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable\". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[467][468][469][470] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"[471][472] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[473][474] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[475] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[476] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America’s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[477][478] Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[479] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[480] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces\".[481][482] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied \"You have said the actual truth.\"[481][482] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[483] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".[484] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[485] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[486][487] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[488][489] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[490] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[491][492] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[493] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done.\"[494][495] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[496] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[497] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour.\"[498] COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[499][500] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[501] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[502][503] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[499] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[500] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[504] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[505][506] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[499][507][508] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[509][510] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[510] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[511][512] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[513] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[514] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[513] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[515][516] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[517][518] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[519] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[519][520] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[521] Personal life In 2002, Musk became a U.S. citizen.[522] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[523] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[523][524][525] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[526][527] During a South African safari in late 2000, he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California.[528] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[529] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[530][531] Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression,[532] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[533][534][535] Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[2] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[536] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[537] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[538] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[538] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[539][540] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[541] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[541] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[542][543] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son [sic], essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son [sic] is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[544] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic”, whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[545] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[546] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[547][548] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[549] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[549] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[550] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[551] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[552] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[553] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[554][555] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[556][557] which they then changed to \"“X Æ A-Xii”.[558][559] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[560] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[1] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[561][562] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[1] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[563] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[564] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[565][566][567] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[568] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[569] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[570][2] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[571] Musk denied the report.[572] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend.\"[573] Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[574] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[575][576] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[577] and Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[578] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[579] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[579] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[580][581] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[582] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[583][584][585] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[583] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[583][584][586] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[587] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[588][589] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[590][591][592] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[590][592] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[593] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[594] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[595] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, though much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[596] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies.\"[597] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[598] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[599] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[600][601][602] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[603] Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk (right) and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[604] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[605] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[606] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[607] Why Him? (2016),[608] and Men in Black: International (2019).[609] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[610] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[611] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[612][613] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[614] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[615][616] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[617] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[618][619] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[620] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[621] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[622] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[623] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[624] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[625] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[626] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[627] 2013,[628] 2018,[629] and 2021.[630] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[631][632] Notes and references Notes ^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[77][78] ^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[107][108] ^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[156] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[157][158] ^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[211] Citations ^ a b c Gordon, Devin (March 10, 2022). \"\"Infamy Is Kind Of Fun\": Grimes on Music, Mars, and—Surprise!—Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\".

LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp. 6, 8, 10. \"There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in Pretoria, there was a boy who wanted to be a man.\" (p. 10.)

Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024[update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.[3] Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[4] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these.[5][4][6] His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Early life and education Childhood and family See also: Family of Elon Musk Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[7][8] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][21] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines.\"[22][23] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[20][24][25][26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school (\"veldskool\") that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[9][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[29] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[30] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless\".[30] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[31] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[30][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][32] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[34][35] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38] Business career Elon Musk has started a number of businesses since 1995, with initial business success and liquidity gained from sales of equity in one business providing the capital for him to start subsequent business enterprises. Musk is widely considered a serial entrepreneur. By the 2020s, several Musk businesses had formed strategic partnerships with some employees playing roles simultaneously in more than one of Musk's companies.[56][57] Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[58][59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period was described by Musk as a \"gray area\".[62][63] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[64] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[65] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[66][67] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[68] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia In March 1999,[69] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[70] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[71] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[69] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[72] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][72][73] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[74] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[75] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[76][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[78][79] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[80][81] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[82][83] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[84] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[85] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[86] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[86] With $100 million of his own money,[87] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[88][89] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[90] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA.[91][92] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[90] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[93] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[94] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[95] Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014 Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[96] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[97] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[98][99] Since 2019,[100] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[101] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[102] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[103] Starlink This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(October 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[104] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[105] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[106][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[109][110][111] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[112] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[113] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[114][115][116] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[117][118] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[119][120][121] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011 Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[126][page needed][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[129][130] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[131] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[132] Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[133] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[134] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[135] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[136] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[137][138] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any kind,[139] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[140] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[141] and delivered in November 2023.[142] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[143] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[144] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[145][146] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[147][148] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[149] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[150] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[150] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[151] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[152] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[153] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[154] SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[155][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[155][159][160] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[161] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[162] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[163] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[164][165] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[166] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[167] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[168] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[169][170] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[171] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[172] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[173] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[174] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[175][176] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[177] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[178][179] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[180][181] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[182] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[183][184] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[184][185] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[186] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[183] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[187] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[188] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[189][190][191] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[189] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[186] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[192] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[193] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[194] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[195] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[196][197] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[198] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[199] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[200][201] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[202] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[203] Twitter / X Further information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022[204] Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[205] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[206][207] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[208] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[209] making him the largest shareholder.[210][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[212] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[213][214] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[210][215] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[216] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[217] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[218][219] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[220][221] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[222] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[223] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[224] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[225] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[226] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[227] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[228] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[228][229] Musk became the CEO instead.[230] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[231][232][233] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[234][235] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[236][237] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[238] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[239][240] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[241] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[245][246] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[247] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[248] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan.\"[249] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals.\"[250] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[251] Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[252] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[253] Musk does not make formal business plans.[253] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[254] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[252][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[255][256][257] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[258] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[259][257] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[257] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[260] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[261] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[252] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[257][262] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[263] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[264] Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276] Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[282] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[283] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[284] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[285] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[286] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[287][288] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision\".[289] OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI (company) In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[290] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[291] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[292] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[293] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[294] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[295] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[296] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[297] Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[298] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[299] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[300][301] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[298][302] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[303] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[304] He then deleted the tweets,[304] apologized,[305] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[306] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[307][308] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[309][310][311] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[312][313] 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[314] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[315] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[316] Music In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[317][318] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[319] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[320] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[321] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[320] Private jet Main articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[322][323] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[322][324] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[325][326][327] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[328] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[329] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[330] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[331] Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[332][333] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal.[334] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[334] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[334] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[335] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[332] Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[336] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[337] Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[338][339] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[340] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[341] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[342] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[343][344] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[345] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[346] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[347] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[348][349] Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[350][351] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[352] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[353] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[354][355][356][357][358] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[359] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[360][361] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[362] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[363][364] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[365] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[366] Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[367] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[368] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[369] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[370] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[371][372] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[373][374][375] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[374][376][375] Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[377] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[378][379] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[380][381] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[382] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[383][384] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[385] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[386] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[387] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[388][389] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[390] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[391] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[392][393] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[394] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[395][396] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[397] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[398] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[399] He later denied the claim.[400] Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 (left), and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 (right) Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[401][402][403][404][405] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[406] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[407][408][409] and numerous conspiracy theories.[410][411] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[412] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[413] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest;[414] however, beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[415] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[416] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[417] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[418] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[419] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[420][421] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections.[422][423] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[424] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[424] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[425][426][427] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[428] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[429] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[430] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[431] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[432] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[432] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[433] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[433] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[434] That same month, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[435][436] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[437] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[438] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[439][440] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[441] and Elizabeth Warren.[442] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[443][444][better source needed] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[445] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[446] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[447] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[448]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[449][450] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[451][452][453] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[454][455] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[456][457][458] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[459][460][461][462] Musk with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023 In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[463] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[464] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and described it as \"jarring.\"[465] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying \"Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"[466] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable\". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[467][468][469][470] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"[471][472] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[473][474] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[475] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[476] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America’s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[477][478] Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[479] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[480] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces\".[481][482] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied \"You have said the actual truth.\"[481][482] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[483] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".[484] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[485] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[486][487] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[488][489] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[490] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[491][492] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[493] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done.\"[494][495] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[496] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[497] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour.\"[498] COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[499][500] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[501] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[502][503] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[499] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[500] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[504] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[505][506] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[499][507][508] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[509][510] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[510] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[511][512] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[513] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[514] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[513] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[515][516] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[517][518] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[519] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[519][520] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[521] Personal life In 2002, Musk became a U.S. citizen.[522] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[523] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[523][524][525] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[526][527] During a South African safari in late 2000, he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California.[528] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[529] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[530][531] Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression,[532] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[533][534][535] Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[2] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[536] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[537] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[538] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[538] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[539][540] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[541] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[541] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[542][543] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son [sic], essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son [sic] is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[544] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic”, whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[545] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[546] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[547][548] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[549] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[549] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[550] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[551] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[552] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[553] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[554][555] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[556][557] which they then changed to \"“X Æ A-Xii”.[558][559] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[560] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[1] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[561][562] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[1] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[563] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[564] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[565][566][567] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[568] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[569] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[570][2] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[571] Musk denied the report.[572] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend.\"[573] Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[574] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[575][576] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[577] and Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[578] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[579] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[579] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[580][581] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[582] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[583][584][585] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[583] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[583][584][586] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[587] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[588][589] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[590][591][592] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[590][592] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[593] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[594] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[595] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, though much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[596] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies.\"[597] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[598] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[599] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[600][601][602] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[603] Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk (right) and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[604] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[605] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[606] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[607] Why Him? (2016),[608] and Men in Black: International (2019).[609] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[610] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[611] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[612][613] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[614] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[615][616] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[617] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[618][619] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[620] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[621] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[622] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[623] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[624] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[625] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[626] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[627] 2013,[628] 2018,[629] and 2021.[630] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[631][632] Notes and references Notes ^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[77][78] ^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[107][108] ^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[156] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[157][158] ^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[211] Citations ^ a b c Gordon, Devin (March 10, 2022). \"\"Infamy Is Kind Of Fun\": Grimes on Music, Mars, and—Surprise!—Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\".

Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024[update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.[3] Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[4] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these.[5][4][6] His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Early life and education Childhood and family See also: Family of Elon Musk Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[7][8] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][21] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines.\"[22][23] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[20][24][25][26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school (\"veldskool\") that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[9][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[29] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[30] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless\".[30] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[31] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[30][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][32] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[34][35] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38] Business career Elon Musk has started a number of businesses since 1995, with initial business success and liquidity gained from sales of equity in one business providing the capital for him to start subsequent business enterprises. Musk is widely considered a serial entrepreneur. By the 2020s, several Musk businesses had formed strategic partnerships with some employees playing roles simultaneously in more than one of Musk's companies.[56][57] Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[58][59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period was described by Musk as a \"gray area\".[62][63] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[64] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[65] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[66][67] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[68] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia In March 1999,[69] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[70] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[71] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[69] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[72] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][72][73] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[74] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[75] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[76][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[78][79] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[80][81] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[82][83] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[84] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[85] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[86] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[86] With $100 million of his own money,[87] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[88][89] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[90] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA.[91][92] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[90] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[93] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[94] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[95] Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014 Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[96] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[97] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[98][99] Since 2019,[100] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[101] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[102] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[103] Starlink This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies.

(October 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[104] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[105] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[106][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[109][110][111] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[112] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[113] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[114][115][116] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[117][118] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[119][120][121] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011 Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[126][page needed][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[129][130] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[131] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[132] Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[133] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[134] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[135] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[136] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[137][138] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any kind,[139] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[140] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[141] and delivered in November 2023.[142] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[143] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[144] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[145][146] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[147][148] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[149] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[150] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[150] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[151] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[152] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[153] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[154] SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[155][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[155][159][160] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[161] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[162] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[163] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[164][165] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[166] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[167] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[168] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[169][170] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[171] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[172] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[173] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[174] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[175][176] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[177] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[178][179] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[180][181] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[182] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[183][184] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[184][185] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[186] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[183] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[187] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[188] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[189][190][191] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[189] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[186] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[192] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[193] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[194] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[195] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[196][197] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[198] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[199] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[200][201] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[202] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[203] Twitter / X Further information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022[204] Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[205] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[206][207] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[208] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[209] making him the largest shareholder.[210][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[212] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[213][214] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[210][215] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[216] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[217] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[218][219] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[220][221] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[222] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[223] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[224] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[225] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[226] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[227] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[228] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[228][229] Musk became the CEO instead.[230] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[231][232][233] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[234][235] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[236][237] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[238] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[239][240] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[241] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[245][246] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[247] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[248] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan.\"[249] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals.\"[250] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[251] Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[252] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[253] Musk does not make formal business plans.[253] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[254] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[252][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[255][256][257] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[258] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[259][257] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[257] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[260] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[261] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[252] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[257][262] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[263] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[264] Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276] Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[282] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[283] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[284] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[285] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[286] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[287][288] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision\".[289] OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI (company) In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[290] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[291] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[292] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[293] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[294] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[295] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[296] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[297] Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[298] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[299] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[300][301] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[298][302] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[303] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[304] He then deleted the tweets,[304] apologized,[305] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[306] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[307][308] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[309][310][311] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[312][313] 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[314] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[315] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[316] Music In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[317][318] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[319] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[320] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[321] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[320] Private jet Main articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[322][323] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[322][324] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[325][326][327] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[328] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[329] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[330] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[331] Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[332][333] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal.[334] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[334] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[334] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[335] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[332] Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[336] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[337] Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[338][339] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[340] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[341] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[342] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[343][344] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[345] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[346] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[347] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[348][349] Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[350][351] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[352] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[353] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[354][355][356][357][358] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[359] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[360][361] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[362] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[363][364] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[365] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[366] Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[367] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[368] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[369] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[370] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[371][372] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[373][374][375] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[374][376][375] Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[377] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[378][379] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[380][381] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[382] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[383][384] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[385] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[386] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[387] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[388][389] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[390] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[391] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[392][393] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[394] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[395][396] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[397] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[398] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[399] He later denied the claim.[400] Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 (left), and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 (right) Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[401][402][403][404][405] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[406] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[407][408][409] and numerous conspiracy theories.[410][411] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[412] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[413] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest;[414] however, beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[415] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[416] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[417] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[418] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[419] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[420][421] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections.[422][423] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[424] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[424] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[425][426][427] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[428] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[429] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[430] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[431] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[432] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[432] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[433] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[433] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[434] That same month, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[435][436] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[437] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[438] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[439][440] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[441] and Elizabeth Warren.[442] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[443][444][better source needed] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[445] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[446] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[447] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[448]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[449][450] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[451][452][453] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[454][455] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[456][457][458] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[459][460][461][462] Musk with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023 In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[463] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[464] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and described it as \"jarring.\"[465] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying \"Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"[466] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable\". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[467][468][469][470] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"[471][472] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[473][474] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[475] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[476] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America’s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[477][478] Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[479] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[480] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces\".[481][482] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied \"You have said the actual truth.\"[481][482] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[483] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".[484] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[485] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[486][487] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[488][489] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[490] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[491][492] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[493] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done.\"[494][495] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[496] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[497] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour.\"[498] COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[499][500] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[501] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[502][503] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[499] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[500] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[504] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[505][506] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[499][507][508] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[509][510] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[510] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[511][512] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[513] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[514] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[513] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[515][516] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[517][518] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[519] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[519][520] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[521] Personal life In 2002, Musk became a U.S. citizen.[522] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[523] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[523][524][525] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[526][527] During a South African safari in late 2000, he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California.[528] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[529] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[530][531] Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression,[532] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[533][534][535] Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[2] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[536] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[537] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[538] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[538] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[539][540] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[541] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[541] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[542][543] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son [sic], essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son [sic] is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[544] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic”, whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[545] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[546] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[547][548] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[549] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[549] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[550] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[551] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[552] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[553] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[554][555] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[556][557] which they then changed to \"“X Æ A-Xii”.[558][559] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[560] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[1] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[561][562] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[1] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[563] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[564] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[565][566][567] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[568] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[569] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[570][2] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[571] Musk denied the report.[572] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend.\"[573] Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[574] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[575][576] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[577] and Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[578] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[579] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[579] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[580][581] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[582] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[583][584][585] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[583] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[583][584][586] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[587] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[588][589] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[590][591][592] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[590][592] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[593] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[594] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[595] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, though much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[596] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies.\"[597] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[598] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[599] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[600][601][602] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[603] Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk (right) and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[604] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[605] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[606] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[607] Why Him? (2016),[608] and Men in Black: International (2019).[609] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[610] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[611] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[612][613] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[614] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[615][616] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[617] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[618][619] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[620] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[621] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[622] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[623] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[624] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[625] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[626] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[627] 2013,[628] 2018,[629] and 2021.[630] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[631][632] Notes and references Notes ^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[77][78] ^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[107][108] ^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[156] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[157][158] ^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[211] Citations ^ a b c Gordon, Devin (March 10, 2022). \"\"Infamy Is Kind Of Fun\": Grimes on Music, Mars, and—Surprise!—Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\".

LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp. 6, 8, 10. \"There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way.

Other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. He is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world; as of August 2024[update] Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$247 billion.[3] Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002 Musk acquired US citizenship. That October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor who provided most of the initial financing in the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure.[4] He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and \"endorsing an antisemitic theory\"; he later apologized for the last of these.[5][4][6] His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including X Premium verification. Early life and education Childhood and family See also: Family of Elon Musk Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[7][8] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[9][10] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[11][12][13] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[13][18] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][21] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Musk and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines.\"[22][23] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[7] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[20][24][25][26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school (\"veldskool\") that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[9][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[28] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[29] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[30] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless\".[30] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\"[31] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[30][31] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[16][32] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[33] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[34][35] Education Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[42] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk has said that he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997.[50][47][51] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[52] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[53][54] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[47][51] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[55][38] Business career Elon Musk has started a number of businesses since 1995, with initial business success and liquidity gained from sales of equity in one business providing the capital for him to start subsequent business enterprises. Musk is widely considered a serial entrepreneur. By the 2020s, several Musk businesses had formed strategic partnerships with some employees playing roles simultaneously in more than one of Musk's companies.[56][57] Zip2 Main article: Zip2 External videos Musk speaks of his early business experience during a 2014 commencement speech at University of Southern California on YouTube In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[58][59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61] with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period was described by Musk as a \"gray area\".[62][63] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[52] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[64] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[65] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[66][67] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[68] X.com and PayPal Main articles: X.com (bank), PayPal, and PayPal Mafia In March 1999,[69] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[70] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[71] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[69] Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[72] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[61][72][73] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[74] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[75] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[76][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[78][79] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[80][81] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[82][83] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[84] SpaceX Main article: SpaceX Then-NASA Administrator Charles Bolden congratulating Musk by the SpaceX Dragon following its 2012 mission In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[85] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[86] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[86] With $100 million of his own money,[87] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[88][89] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[90] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA.[91][92] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[90] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[93] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[94] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[95] Musk examining F9R Dev1 debris in 2014 Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[96] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[97] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[98][99] Since 2019,[100] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[101] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[102] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[103] Starlink This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help improve it by rewriting it in a balanced fashion that contextualizes different points of view. (October 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message) Main article: Starlink See also: Starlink in the Russo-Ukrainian War 50 Starlink satellites shortly before deployment to low Earth orbit, 2019 In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[104] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[105] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[106][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[109][110][111] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[112] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[113] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[114][115][116] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[117][118] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[119][120][121] Tesla Main article: Tesla, Inc. Musk next to a Tesla Model S, 2011 Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[122] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[123][124] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[125] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[126][page needed][127] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[128] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[129][130] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[131] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[132] Musk before a Model X at the 2014 Tesla Inc. annual shareholder meeting Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[133] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[134] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[135] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[136] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[137][138] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any kind,[139] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[140] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[141] and delivered in November 2023.[142] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[143] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[144] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[145][146] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[147][148] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[149] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell 10% of his Tesla stock, since \"much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance\".[150] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[150] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[151] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[152] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[153] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[154] SEC and shareholder lawsuits regarding tweets In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[155][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[155][159][160] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[161] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[162] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[163] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[164][165] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[166] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[167] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[168] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[169][170] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[171] SolarCity and Tesla Energy Main articles: SolarCity and Tesla Energy SolarCity solar-panel installation vans in 2009 Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[172] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[173] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[174] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[175][176] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[177] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[178][179] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[180][181] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[182] Neuralink Main article: Neuralink Musk discussing a Neuralink device during a live demonstration in 2020 In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[183][184] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[184][185] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[186] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[183] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[187] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[188] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[189][190][191] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[189] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[186] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[192] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[193] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[194] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[195] The Boring Company Main article: The Boring Company Musk during the 2018 inauguration of the Boring Test Tunnel in Hawthorne, California In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[196][197] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[198] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[199] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[200][201] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[202] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[203] Twitter / X Further information: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and Twitter under Elon Musk Elon Musk @elonmusk I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... April 14, 2022[204] Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[205] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[206][207] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[208] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[209] making him the largest shareholder.[210][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[212] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[213][214] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[210][215] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[216] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[217] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[218][219] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[220][221] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[222] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[223] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[224] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[225] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[226] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[227] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[228] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[228][229] Musk became the CEO instead.[230] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[231][232][233] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[234][235] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[236][237] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[238] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[239][240] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[241] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[245][246] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[247] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[248] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan.\"[249] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals.\"[250] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[251] Leadership style Musk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012 Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[252] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[253] Musk does not make formal business plans.[253] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[254] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[252][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[255][256][257] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[258] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[259][257] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[257] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[260] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[261] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[252] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding.\"[257][262] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[263] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some employees resigning in consequence.[264] Other activities Musk Foundation Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[265][266] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[267] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[268] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[269] which was a nonprofit at the time.[270] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[271] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[272] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[273] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[269] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[268] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[274] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[275] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[276] Hyperloop Main articles: Hyperloop and Hyperloop pod competition A tube part of the 2017 Hyperloop pod competition sponsored by SpaceX In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[277] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[278] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[279] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[280] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[281] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[282] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[283] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[284] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[285] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[286] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[287][288] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision\".[289] OpenAI and xAI Further information: OpenAI and xAI (company) In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[290] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[28] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[291] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[292] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[293] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[294] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[295] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[296] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[297] Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case Further information: Tham Luang cave rescue In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[298] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[299] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[300][301] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[298][302] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[303] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[304] He then deleted the tweets,[304] apologized,[305] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[306] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[307][308] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[309][310][311] In his defense, Musk argued that \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor\".[36] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury found in favor of Musk and ruled he was not liable.[312][313] 2018 cannabis incident In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[314] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[315] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[316] Music In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[317][318] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[319] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[320] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[321] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[320] Private jet Main articles: ElonJet and 2022 Twitter suspensions Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[322][323] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[322][324] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[325][326][327] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[328] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[329] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[330] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[331] Company towns Main articles: Boca Chica Village, Texas and Snailbrook, Texas After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[332][333] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by the Wall Street Journal.[334] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[334] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[334] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[335] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[332] Wealth Main article: Wealth of Elon Musk Musk made $175.8 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in October 2002.[336] He was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[337] Personal views and Twitter usage Further information: Views of Elon Musk Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[338][339] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[340] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[341] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[342] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[343][344] and comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[345] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[346] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[347] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[348][349] Finance Musk said that the U.S. government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[350][351] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[352] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[353] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[354][355][356][357][358] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[359] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[360][361] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[362] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[363][364] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[365] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[366] Technology Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[367] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[368] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[369] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[370] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[371][372] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[373][374][375] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[374][376][375] Existential threats Musk giving details about Falcon 9 and Dragon spacecraft at the 2006 Mars Society Conference Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[377] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[378][379] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[380][381] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[382] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[383][384] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[385] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[386] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[387] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[388][389] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[390] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[391] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[392][393] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[394] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[395][396] saying that \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[397] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[398] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[399] He later denied the claim.[400] Politics Musk with Senator Dianne Feinstein at the opening of the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2010 (left), and with Vice President Mike Pence alongside then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at the Kennedy Space Center before SpaceX's Crew Dragon Demo-2 launch in 2020 (right) Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[401][402][403][404][405] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[406] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[407][408][409] and numerous conspiracy theories.[410][411] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[412] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans,[413] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest;[414] however, beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[415] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[416] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[417] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[418] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[419] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[420][421] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 U.S. elections.[422][423] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[424] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[424] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[425][426][427] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[428] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[429] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[430] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[431] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[432] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[432] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[433] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[433] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[434] That same month, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[435][436] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[437] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[438] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[439][440] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[441] and Elizabeth Warren.[442] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[443][444][better source needed] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[445] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[446] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[447] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[448]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[449][450] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[451][452][453] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[454][455] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[456][457][458] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[459][460][461][462] Musk with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, November 27, 2023 In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel.\" He added that \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[463] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[464] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel by visiting the kibbutz Kfar Aza with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which had been part of the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and described it as \"jarring.\"[465] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying \"Shouldn’t you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\"[466] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable\". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[467][468][469][470] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\"[471][472] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainments camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[473][474] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[475] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[476] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America’s Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[477][478] Accusations of antisemitism The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[479] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[480] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces\".[481][482] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied \"You have said the actual truth.\"[481][482] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[483] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".[484] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[485] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites.\"[486][487] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[488][489] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[490] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[491][492] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[493] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done.\"[494][495] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[496] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[497] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour.\"[498] COVID-19 Musk wearing a bandana as a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[499][500] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[501] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[502][503] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the U.S. population.[499] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero new cases in [the U.S.] by end of April\".[500] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[504] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[505][506] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[499][507][508] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[509][510] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[510] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[511][512] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[513] After figures like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[514] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[513] However, Musk ended up buying and donating BiPAP and CPAP machines, which are devices that support respirations of someone able to breathe on their own, rather than the much more expensive and sought-after mechanical ventilator machines that are able to breathe for a patient entirely.[515][516] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[517][518] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[519] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[519][520] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[521] Personal life In 2002, Musk became a U.S. citizen.[522] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[523] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[523][524][525] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[526][527] During a South African safari in late 2000, he contracted malaria and was then hospitalized in an intensive care unit back in California.[528] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[529] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[530][531] Musk has stated he uses prescribed ketamine for occasional depression,[532] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[533][534][535] Relationships and children Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[2] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[536] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[537] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[538] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[538] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[539][540] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[541] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[541] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[542][543] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son [sic], essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son [sic] is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[544] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; claiming that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic”, whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[545] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[546] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[547][548] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[549] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[549] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[550] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[551] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[552] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[553] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[554][555] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[556][557] which they then changed to \"“X Æ A-Xii”.[558][559] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[560] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[1] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[561][562] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[1] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[563] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[564] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[565][566][567] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[568] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[569] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[570][2] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[571] Musk denied the report.[572] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend.\"[573] Legal matters after 2020 Further information: Personal and business legal affairs of Elon Musk; List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.; and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[574] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light\". He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[575][576] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[577] and Barron's wrote \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[578] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[579] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[579] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[580][581] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[582] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[583][584][585] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[583] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[583][584][586] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[587] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[588][589] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[590][591][592] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[590][592] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[593] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[594] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[595] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, though much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[596] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies.\"[597] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[598] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[599] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[600][601][602] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged “acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[603] Public perception Further information: Elon Musk filmography and List of awards and honors received by Elon Musk Musk (right) and then-President Barack Obama at the Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, launch site of the SpaceX Falcon 9, 2010 Though his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[604] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[605] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[606] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[607] Why Him? (2016),[608] and Men in Black: International (2019).[609] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[610] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[611] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[612][613] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[614] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[615][616] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[617] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[618][619] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[620] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[621] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[622] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[623] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[624] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[625] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[626] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[627] 2013,[628] 2018,[629] and 2021.[630] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too\".[631][632] Notes and references Notes ^ Musk remained on the board and served as an advisor.[77][78] ^ SpaceX received nearly $900 million in Federal Communications Commission subsidies for Starlink.[107][108] ^ Musk stated he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, an alleged reference to marijuana.[156] Members of Tesla's board and rapper Azealia Banks alleged that Musk may have been under the influence of recreational drugs when he wrote the tweet.[157][158] ^ He did not file the necessary SEC paperwork within 10 days of his stake passing 5%, a violation of U.S. securities laws.[211] Citations ^ a b c Gordon, Devin (March 10, 2022). \"\"Infamy Is Kind Of Fun\": Grimes on Music, Mars, and—Surprise!—Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\".

LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp. 6, 8, 10. \"There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in Pretoria, there was a boy who wanted to be a man.\" (p. 10.)

      "Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (née Haldeman), a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.

In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\n",

Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[242][243] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[244]\n",

His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house.

LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp. 6, 8, 10. \"There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. Aristotle says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in Pretoria, there was a boy who wanted to be a man.\" (p. 10.)\n",

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services. Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines. History Main article: History of Tesla, Inc. Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010 Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9][10] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[11] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[12] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[16] Roadster (2005–2009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[17] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18] In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20] In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25] Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[26][27] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[28] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[29] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[30][31] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42 million.[32] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[35] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012 the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[36] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[37] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[38] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[39] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[40] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[41] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[42] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[43] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[44][45] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[46] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[47] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[48] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[49] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55] This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[58] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[59] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[60] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[61] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[62] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[62][63] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[64][65] Deliveries started in March 2020.[66] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81] In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[90] In June 2024, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[91] Automotive products and services \"Tesla electric car\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Nikola Tesla electric car hoax. As of November 2023[update], Tesla offers six vehicle models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Tesla Semi, and Cybertruck.

The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[64] and deliveries started in March 2020.[66] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[65] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first electric vehicle to claim the title.[97] Tesla Semi Main article: Tesla Semi Tesla Semi prototype The Tesla Semi is a Class 8 semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[98] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[99] As of December 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production.[3] An update in 2024 indicates full production to occur in 2025.[100] Cybertruck Main article: Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Cybertruck The Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km), depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[101][102][103] Announced products Roadster (second generation) Main article: Tesla Roadster (second generation) Tesla Roadster prototype On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[104] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[105] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[105] The base price was set at $200,000.[105] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[106] Tesla next-generation vehicle Main article: Tesla next-generation vehicle The Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[107] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[106] Discontinued Tesla Roadster Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) The original Roadster The original Tesla Roadster[108] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[109] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. Connectivity services Tesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[110] Vehicle servicing Tesla's strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[111][112] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[113] In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[114] Charging services Supercharger network Main article: Tesla Supercharger Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers. Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount. Destination charging location network \"Destination Charger\" in North America Tesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[115] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[116] Insurance services Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[117] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[118] The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[119] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[120] As of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[121] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[119] Energy products Main article: Tesla Energy Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[122] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[123] Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[124][125][126] For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[127][128][129] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[130] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[131][132] Business strategy Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[137] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[138][139] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[140][141] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147] Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151] Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154] On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.[155] On May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges. [156] Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] Batteries Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors As of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[157][158][159] Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[160] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[161] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163] 2170 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product. For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[163] 4680 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163] Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170] Research Tesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[171] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[172] – and sold in 2021.[173] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[174][175] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[176][177] Software Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179] The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181] Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster. Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185] North American Charging Standard Main article: North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186] Autopilot and Full Self-Driving This section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit] Tesla Autopilot in operation Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[187] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision. The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[188][189] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[190] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla's decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[191][192][193][194] Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[195] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[196] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[197] Grohmann Automation,[198] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[199] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] Subsequently, the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots previously required.[200][201] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[202] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[203] Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[204] Facilities See also: List of Tesla factories The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2024[update], the company also operates more than 1,200 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3] Primary facilities operated by Tesla Opened Name City Country Employees Products Ref. 2010 Tesla Fremont Factory Fremont, California United States 22,000 Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y [32][205][206] 2016 Gigafactory Nevada Storey County, Nevada United States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [207][208][209] 2017 Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York United States 1,500 Solar Roof, Supercharger [210][211] 2019 Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger [212][213] 2022 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model Y [214][215][216] 2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United States 12,000 Model Y, Cybertruck [217][218][219] North America Main articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012 Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[220] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[221] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[222] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[223] Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[224] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[32] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[207] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[225] Model 3 drivetrains,[226] and the Tesla Semi.[227] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years,[228] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[227] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[229][230] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[210] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[231] In 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[232] Gigafactory Texas in 2022 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[233] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[234] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[72] Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[235][236] The location opened in 2022. Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building.[237] Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July 2024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election, because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[238] Europe Main articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[239] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[240] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[241] In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[242] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[243] Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[244] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[245] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[246] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[247][248] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[248] Asia Main article: Gigafactory Shanghai Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[249] Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[250] In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[251] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[212] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[252] Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[253] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[254] Partners Panasonic Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[255] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[256] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[257] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[210] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[258][259] In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[260] Other current partners Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[261] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[262] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[263] Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[264] Former partners Daimler The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[265] Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[266][267] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[268] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[269] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[270] Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[271][272] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[273][274] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[275] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[276] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[277][278] Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[32] In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[279] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[280][281] based on components from the Roadster.[282] The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[283] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[284][285] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[286] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[286][160] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[287][288] Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[289] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[290] Lawsuits and controversies Main articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Sexual harassment In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[291] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[292] Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[293] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[294] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[293] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[295] In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[296] Labor disputes See also: Tesla and unions United States In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[297] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[298] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[299] and customers[300] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[301][302] From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[303] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[304] In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[305][306][307] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[308][309] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[310] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[311] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[312] In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[313][314] In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[315][316] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[317] The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[318] Europe In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[319][320][321] Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[322] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[323] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[324] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[325] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[326][327] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[328] From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[329] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[330] A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[331] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[332] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[333][334] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[335] In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[336] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[337][338][339] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[340] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[340] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[341][342] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[343] In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[344] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[344] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[345][346][347] In May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[348] Tesla US dealership disputes See also: Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[145] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[349][350][351] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[352] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[142] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[145] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[113] Intellectual property In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[353] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[354] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[355] Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[356] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[357] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[358] Misappropriation In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[342] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[359] In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[360] Environmental violations In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[361] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[362] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[363] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[364] In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[365] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[366][305] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[367][368] In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". On top of that, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla's facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[369][370][371] Property damage In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[372] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[373] In April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[374][375] Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[376][377] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[378] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[379] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[380] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[381] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[382] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[383] and physically demanding work.[384] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[385] In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[386] In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[387][388] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[389][390] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[391] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[392] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[393] Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[394] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors. COVID-19 pandemic Tesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[395] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[396] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[397][398][399] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[400][401] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[402] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[403] In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[404] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[405] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[406] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[395][407] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[408] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[408] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[408] Right to repair In March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[409][410] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[411][412] While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla's restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[411][412] Criticism Main article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[413][414] A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[415] Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[416] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[417] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[418] Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[419] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[420] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[421] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[422] Tesla's mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[423] Giga New York audit In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[424][425][426] Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[427][428] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[429] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[430] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[431] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[432] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[433] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[434] Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[435][436] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[437] In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[438] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[439][440] In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[441] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[442][443] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[444] Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[445][446] In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[447] On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[448] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[449] In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[450][451] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[451] In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[452] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[453] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[454] In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[455] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[456] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[456][457] Fires See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla Tesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[458] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[459] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[460] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[461] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[462] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[463][464][465] Autopilot crashes See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[466][467] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[468] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[469] According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[470][471] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[472] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[472][473][474] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[475] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[476] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[477] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[478] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[479] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[480] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[481] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[482] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[483] In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[484] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[485] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[486] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[487][488] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[489] In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[490] Phantom braking In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[491] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[492] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[493] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[494] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[495] Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[496] Vehicle sales In 2023, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 19.9%.[497] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[498][499] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[500] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[501] Production and sales by quarter See also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 3 2012 4 1 2 2013 3 4 1 2 2014 3 4 1 2 2015 3 4 1 2 2016 3 4 1 2 2017 3 4 1 2 2018 3 4 1 2 2019 3 4 1 2 2020 3 4 1 2 2021 3 4 1 2 2022 3 4 1 2 2023 3 4 1 2 2024 3 Model S Model X Model S/X Models Other Than 3/Y Model 3 Model 3/Y Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[502] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[503] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[504] Finances Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.Tesla financial performance For the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[505] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[505] Sales by business (2023)[506] Business Sales in billion $ share Automotive 90.7 93.8% Energy Generation and Storage 6.0 6.2% Sales by region (2023)[506] Region Sales in billion $ share United States 45.2 46.7% Other countries 29.8 30.8% China 21.5 22.5% Of the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[505] Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[142]: 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[82] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[507][508] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[509][510] The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[511] The key trends for Tesla are (as at the financial year ending December 31): Year Revenue(US$ m) Net income(US$ m) Total assets(US$ m) Employees Sources 2005 0 −12 8 2006 0 −30 44 70 [512][513] 2007 0.073 −78 34 268 2008 15 −83 52 252 2009 112 −56 130 514 2010 117 −154 386 899 [513] 2011 204 −254 713 1,417 [513] 2012 413 −396 1,114 2,914 [513] 2013 2,013 −74 2,417 5,859 [513] 2014 3,198 −294 5,831 10,161 [513] 2015 4,046 −889 8,068 13,058 [513] 2016 7,000 −675 22,664 17,782 [513] 2017 11,759 −1,962 28,655 37,543 [513] 2018 21,461 −976 29,740 48,817 [513] 2019 24,578 −862 34,309 48,016 [513] 2020 31,536 721 52,148 70,757 [513] 2021 53,823 5,519 62,131 99,290 [513] 2022 81,462 12,556 82,338 127,855 [513] 2023 96,773 14,997 106,618 140,473 [513] Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard (2004–2007) Ze'ev Drori (2007–2008)[514][515] Elon Musk (since October 2008)[516] List of board chairs Elon Musk (2004–2018)[517] Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[516] Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[518] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[519] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[520] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[521] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[519] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[519] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[522] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[523] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[524] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[525] Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[526] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[527] Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[268] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[528] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[529][530] As of May 2023[update], the board members are:[531] Joined Name Titles Independent 2014[532] Robyn Denholm Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra[527] Yes 2004[15] Elon Musk CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX No 2004[533] Kimbal Musk SpaceX board member[534] No 2007[535] Ira Ehrenpreis General Partner at Technology Partners[528] Disputed[518] 2017[528] James Murdoch Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[528] Yes 2018[520] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[520] Yes 2022[536] Joe Gebbia Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[537] Yes 2023[525] J.

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services. Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines. History Main article: History of Tesla, Inc. Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010 Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9][10] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[11] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[12] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[16] Roadster (2005–2009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[17] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18] In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20] In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25] Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[26][27] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[28] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[29] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[30][31] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42 million.[32] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[35] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012 the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[36] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[37] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[38] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[39] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[40] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[41] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[42] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[43] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[44][45] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[46] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[47] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[48] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[49] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55] This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[58] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[59] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[60] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[61] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[62] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[62][63] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[64][65] Deliveries started in March 2020.[66] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81] In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[90] In June 2024, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[91] Automotive products and services \"Tesla electric car\" redirects here.

Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[98] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[99] As of December 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production.[3] An update in 2024 indicates full production to occur in 2025.[100] Cybertruck Main article: Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Cybertruck The Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km), depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[101][102][103] Announced products Roadster (second generation) Main article: Tesla Roadster (second generation) Tesla Roadster prototype On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[104] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[105] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[105] The base price was set at $200,000.[105] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[106] Tesla next-generation vehicle Main article: Tesla next-generation vehicle The Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[107] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[106] Discontinued Tesla Roadster Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) The original Roadster The original Tesla Roadster[108] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[109] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. Connectivity services Tesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[110] Vehicle servicing Tesla's strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[111][112] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[113] In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[114] Charging services Supercharger network Main article: Tesla Supercharger Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers. Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount. Destination charging location network \"Destination Charger\" in North America Tesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[115] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[116] Insurance services Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[117] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[118] The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[119] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[120] As of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[121] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[119] Energy products Main article: Tesla Energy Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[122] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[123] Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[124][125][126] For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[127][128][129] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[130] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[131][132] Business strategy Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[137] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[138][139] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[140][141] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147] Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151] Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154] On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.[155] On May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges. [156] Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] Batteries Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors As of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[157][158][159] Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[160] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[161] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163] 2170 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product. For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[163] 4680 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163] Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170] Research Tesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[171] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[172] – and sold in 2021.[173] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[174][175] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[176][177] Software Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179] The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181] Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster. Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185] North American Charging Standard Main article: North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186] Autopilot and Full Self-Driving This section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit] Tesla Autopilot in operation Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[187] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision. The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[188][189] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[190] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla's decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[191][192][193][194] Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[195] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[196] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[197] Grohmann Automation,[198] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[199] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] Subsequently, the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots previously required.[200][201] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[202] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[203] Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[204] Facilities See also: List of Tesla factories The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2024[update], the company also operates more than 1,200 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3] Primary facilities operated by Tesla Opened Name City Country Employees Products Ref. 2010 Tesla Fremont Factory Fremont, California United States 22,000 Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y [32][205][206] 2016 Gigafactory Nevada Storey County, Nevada United States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [207][208][209] 2017 Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York United States 1,500 Solar Roof, Supercharger [210][211] 2019 Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger [212][213] 2022 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model Y [214][215][216] 2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United States 12,000 Model Y, Cybertruck [217][218][219] North America Main articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012 Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[220] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[221] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[222] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[223] Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[224] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[32] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[207] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[225] Model 3 drivetrains,[226] and the Tesla Semi.[227] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years,[228] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[227] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[229][230] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[210] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[231] In 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[232] Gigafactory Texas in 2022 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[233] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[234] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[72] Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[235][236] The location opened in 2022. Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building.[237] Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July 2024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election, because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[238] Europe Main articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[239] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[240] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[241] In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[242] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[243] Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[244] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[245] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[246] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[247][248] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[248] Asia Main article: Gigafactory Shanghai Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[249] Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[250] In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[251] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[212] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[252] Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[253] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[254] Partners Panasonic Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[255] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[256] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[257] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[210] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[258][259] In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[260] Other current partners Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[261] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[262] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[263] Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[264] Former partners Daimler The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[265] Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[266][267] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[268] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[269] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[270] Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[271][272] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[273][274] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[275] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[276] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[277][278] Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[32] In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[279] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[280][281] based on components from the Roadster.[282] The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[283] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[284][285] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[286] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[286][160] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[287][288] Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[289] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[290] Lawsuits and controversies Main articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Sexual harassment In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[291] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[292] Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[293] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[294] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[293] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[295] In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[296] Labor disputes See also: Tesla and unions United States In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[297] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[298] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[299] and customers[300] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[301][302] From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[303] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[304] In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[305][306][307] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[308][309] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[310] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[311] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[312] In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[313][314] In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[315][316] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[317] The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[318] Europe In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[319][320][321] Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[322] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[323] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[324] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[325] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[326][327] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[328] From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[329] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[330] A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[331] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[332] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[333][334] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[335] In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[336] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[337][338][339] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[340] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[340] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[341][342] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[343] In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[344] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[344] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[345][346][347] In May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[348] Tesla US dealership disputes See also: Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[145] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[349][350][351] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[352] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[142] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[145] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[113] Intellectual property In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[353] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[354] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[355] Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[356] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[357] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[358] Misappropriation In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[342] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[359] In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[360] Environmental violations In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[361] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[362] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[363] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[364] In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[365] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[366][305] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[367][368] In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". On top of that, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla's facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[369][370][371] Property damage In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[372] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[373] In April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[374][375] Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[376][377] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[378] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[379] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[380] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[381] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[382] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[383] and physically demanding work.[384] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[385] In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[386] In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[387][388] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[389][390] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[391] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[392] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[393] Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[394] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors. COVID-19 pandemic Tesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[395] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[396] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[397][398][399] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[400][401] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[402] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[403] In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[404] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[405] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[406] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[395][407] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[408] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[408] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[408] Right to repair In March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[409][410] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[411][412] While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla's restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[411][412] Criticism Main article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[413][414] A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[415] Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[416] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[417] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[418] Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[419] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[420] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[421] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[422] Tesla's mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[423] Giga New York audit In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[424][425][426] Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[427][428] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[429] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[430] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[431] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[432] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[433] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[434] Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[435][436] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[437] In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[438] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[439][440] In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[441] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[442][443] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[444] Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[445][446] In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[447] On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[448] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[449] In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[450][451] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[451] In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[452] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[453] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[454] In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[455] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[456] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[456][457] Fires See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla Tesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[458] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[459] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[460] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[461] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[462] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[463][464][465] Autopilot crashes See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[466][467] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[468] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[469] According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[470][471] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[472] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[472][473][474] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[475] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[476] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[477] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[478] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[479] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[480] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[481] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[482] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[483] In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[484] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[485] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[486] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[487][488] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[489] In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[490] Phantom braking In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[491] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[492] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[493] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[494] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[495] Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[496] Vehicle sales In 2023, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 19.9%.[497] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[498][499] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[500] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[501] Production and sales by quarter See also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 3 2012 4 1 2 2013 3 4 1 2 2014 3 4 1 2 2015 3 4 1 2 2016 3 4 1 2 2017 3 4 1 2 2018 3 4 1 2 2019 3 4 1 2 2020 3 4 1 2 2021 3 4 1 2 2022 3 4 1 2 2023 3 4 1 2 2024 3 Model S Model X Model S/X Models Other Than 3/Y Model 3 Model 3/Y Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[502] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[503] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[504] Finances Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[505] Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[142]: 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[82] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[507][508] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[509][510] The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[511] The key trends for Tesla are (as at the financial year ending December 31): Year Revenue(US$ m) Net income(US$ m) Total assets(US$ m) Employees Sources 2005 0 −12 8 2006 0 −30 44 70 [512][513] 2007 0.073 −78 34 268 2008 15 −83 52 252 2009 112 −56 130 514 2010 117 −154 386 899 [513] 2011 204 −254 713 1,417 [513] 2012 413 −396 1,114 2,914 [513] 2013 2,013 −74 2,417 5,859 [513] 2014 3,198 −294 5,831 10,161 [513] 2015 4,046 −889 8,068 13,058 [513] 2016 7,000 −675 22,664 17,782 [513] 2017 11,759 −1,962 28,655 37,543 [513] 2018 21,461 −976 29,740 48,817 [513] 2019 24,578 −862 34,309 48,016 [513] 2020 31,536 721 52,148 70,757 [513] 2021 53,823 5,519 62,131 99,290 [513] 2022 81,462 12,556 82,338 127,855 [513] 2023 96,773 14,997 106,618 140,473 [513] Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard (2004–2007) Ze'ev Drori (2007–2008)[514][515] Elon Musk (since October 2008)[516] List of board chairs Elon Musk (2004–2018)[517] Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[516] Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[518] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[519] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[520] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[521] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[519] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[519] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[522] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[523] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[524] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[525] Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[526] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[527] Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[268] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[528] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[529][530] As of May 2023[update], the board members are:[531] Joined Name Titles Independent 2014[532] Robyn Denholm Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra[527] Yes 2004[15] Elon Musk CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX No 2004[533] Kimbal Musk SpaceX board member[534] No 2007[535] Ira Ehrenpreis General Partner at Technology Partners[528] Disputed[518] 2017[528] James Murdoch Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[528] Yes 2018[520] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[520] Yes 2022[536] Joe Gebbia Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[537] Yes 2023[525] J.

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services. Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines. History Main article: History of Tesla, Inc. Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010 Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9][10] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[11] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[12] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[16] Roadster (2005–2009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[17] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18] In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20] In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25] Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[26][27] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[28] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[29] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[30][31] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42 million.[32] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[35] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012 the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[36] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[37] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[38] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[39] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[40] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[41] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[42] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[43] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[44][45] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[46] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[47] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[48] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[49] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55] This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[58] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[59] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[60] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[61] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[62] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[62][63] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[64][65] Deliveries started in March 2020.[66] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81] In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[90] In June 2024, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[91] Automotive products and services \"Tesla electric car\" redirects here.

Model Y Main article: Tesla Model Y Tesla Model Y The Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a single‐motor, rear-wheel drive or a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[64] and deliveries started in March 2020.[66] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[65] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first electric vehicle to claim the title.[97] Tesla Semi Main article: Tesla Semi Tesla Semi prototype The Tesla Semi is a Class 8 semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[98] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[99] As of December 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production.[3] An update in 2024 indicates full production to occur in 2025.[100] Cybertruck Main article: Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Cybertruck The Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km), depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[101][102][103] Announced products Roadster (second generation) Main article: Tesla Roadster (second generation) Tesla Roadster prototype On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[104] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[105] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[105] The base price was set at $200,000.[105] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[106] Tesla next-generation vehicle Main article: Tesla next-generation vehicle The Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[107] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[106] Discontinued Tesla Roadster Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) The original Roadster The original Tesla Roadster[108] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[109] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. Connectivity services Tesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[110] Vehicle servicing Tesla's strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[111][112] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[113] In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[114] Charging services Supercharger network Main article: Tesla Supercharger Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers. Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount. Destination charging location network \"Destination Charger\" in North America Tesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[115] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[116] Insurance services Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[117] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[118] The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[119] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[120] As of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[121] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[119] Energy products Main article: Tesla Energy Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[122] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[123] Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[124][125][126] For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[127][128][129] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[130] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[131][132] Business strategy Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[137] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[138][139] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[140][141] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147] Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151] Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154] On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.[155] On May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges. [156] Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] Batteries Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors As of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[157][158][159] Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[160] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[161] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163] 2170 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product. For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[163] 4680 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163] Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170] Research Tesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[171] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[172] – and sold in 2021.[173] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[174][175] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[176][177] Software Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179] The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181] Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster. Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185] North American Charging Standard Main article: North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186] Autopilot and Full Self-Driving This section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit] Tesla Autopilot in operation Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[187] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision. The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[188][189] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[190] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla's decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[191][192][193][194] Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[195] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[196] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[197] Grohmann Automation,[198] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[199] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] Subsequently, the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots previously required.[200][201] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[202] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[203] Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[204] Facilities See also: List of Tesla factories The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2024[update], the company also operates more than 1,200 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3] Primary facilities operated by Tesla Opened Name City Country Employees Products Ref. 2010 Tesla Fremont Factory Fremont, California United States 22,000 Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y [32][205][206] 2016 Gigafactory Nevada Storey County, Nevada United States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [207][208][209] 2017 Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York United States 1,500 Solar Roof, Supercharger [210][211] 2019 Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger [212][213] 2022 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model Y [214][215][216] 2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United States 12,000 Model Y, Cybertruck [217][218][219] North America Main articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012 Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[220] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[221] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[222] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[223] Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[224] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[32] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[207] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[225] Model 3 drivetrains,[226] and the Tesla Semi.[227] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years,[228] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[227] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[229][230] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[210] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[231] In 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[232] Gigafactory Texas in 2022 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[233] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[234] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[72] Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[235][236] The location opened in 2022. Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building.[237] Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July 2024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election, because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[238] Europe Main articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[239] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[240] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[241] In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[242] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[243] Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[244] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[245] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[246] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[247][248] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[248] Asia Main article: Gigafactory Shanghai Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[249] Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[250] In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[251] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[212] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[252] Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[253] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[254] Partners Panasonic Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[255] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[256] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[257] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[210] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[258][259] In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[260] Other current partners Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[261] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[262] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[263] Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[264] Former partners Daimler The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[265] Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[266][267] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[268] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[269] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[270] Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[271][272] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[273][274] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[275] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[276] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[277][278] Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[32] In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[279] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[280][281] based on components from the Roadster.[282] The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[283] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[284][285] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[286] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[286][160] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[287][288] Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[289] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[290] Lawsuits and controversies Main articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Sexual harassment In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[291] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[292] Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[293] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[294] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[293] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[295] In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[296] Labor disputes See also: Tesla and unions United States In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[297] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[298] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[299] and customers[300] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[301][302] From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[303] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[304] In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[305][306][307] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[308][309] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[310] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[311] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[312] In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[313][314] In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[315][316] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[317] The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[318] Europe In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[319][320][321] Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[322] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[323] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[324] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[325] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[326][327] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[328] From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[329] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[330] A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[331] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[332] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[333][334] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[335] In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[336] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[337][338][339] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[340] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[340] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[341][342] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[343] In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[344] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[344] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[345][346][347] In May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[348] Tesla US dealership disputes See also: Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[145] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[349][350][351] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[352] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[142] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[145] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[113] Intellectual property In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[353] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[354] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[355] Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[356] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[357] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[358] Misappropriation In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[342] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[359] In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[360] Environmental violations In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[361] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[362] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[363] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[364] In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[365] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[366][305] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[367][368] In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". On top of that, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla's facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[369][370][371] Property damage In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[372] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[373] In April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[374][375] Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[376][377] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[378] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[379] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[380] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[381] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[382] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[383] and physically demanding work.[384] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[385] In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[386] In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[387][388] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[389][390] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[391] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[392] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[393] Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[394] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors. COVID-19 pandemic Tesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[395] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[396] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[397][398][399] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[400][401] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[402] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[403] In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[404] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[405] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[406] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[395][407] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[408] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[408] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[408] Right to repair In March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[409][410] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[411][412] While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla's restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[411][412] Criticism Main article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[413][414] A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[415] Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[416] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[417] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[418] Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[419] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[420] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[421] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[422] Tesla's mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[423] Giga New York audit In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[424][425][426] Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[427][428] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[429] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[430] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[431] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[432] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[433] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[434] Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[435][436] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[437] In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[438] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[439][440] In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[441] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[442][443] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[444] Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[445][446] In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[447] On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[448] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[449] In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[450][451] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[451] In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[452] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[453] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[454] In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[455] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[456] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[456][457] Fires See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla Tesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[458] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[459] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[460] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[461] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[462] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[463][464][465] Autopilot crashes See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[466][467] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[468] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[469] According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[470][471] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[472] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[472][473][474] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[475] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[476] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[477] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[478] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[479] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[480] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[481] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[482] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[483] In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[484] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[485] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[486] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[487][488] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[489] In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[490] Phantom braking In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[491] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[492] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[493] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[494] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[495] Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[496] Vehicle sales In 2023, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 19.9%.[497] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[498][499] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[500] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[501] Production and sales by quarter See also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 3 2012 4 1 2 2013 3 4 1 2 2014 3 4 1 2 2015 3 4 1 2 2016 3 4 1 2 2017 3 4 1 2 2018 3 4 1 2 2019 3 4 1 2 2020 3 4 1 2 2021 3 4 1 2 2022 3 4 1 2 2023 3 4 1 2 2024 3 Model S Model X Model S/X Models Other Than 3/Y Model 3 Model 3/Y Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[502] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[503] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[504] Finances Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.Tesla financial performance For the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[505] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[505] Sales by business (2023)[506] Business Sales in billion $ share Automotive 90.7 93.8% Energy Generation and Storage 6.0 6.2% Sales by region (2023)[506] Region Sales in billion $ share United States 45.2 46.7% Other countries 29.8 30.8% China 21.5 22.5% Of the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[505] Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[142]: 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[82] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[507][508] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[509][510] The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[511] The key trends for Tesla are (as at the financial year ending December 31): Year Revenue(US$ m) Net income(US$ m) Total assets(US$ m) Employees Sources 2005 0 −12 8 2006 0 −30 44 70 [512][513] 2007 0.073 −78 34 268 2008 15 −83 52 252 2009 112 −56 130 514 2010 117 −154 386 899 [513] 2011 204 −254 713 1,417 [513] 2012 413 −396 1,114 2,914 [513] 2013 2,013 −74 2,417 5,859 [513] 2014 3,198 −294 5,831 10,161 [513] 2015 4,046 −889 8,068 13,058 [513] 2016 7,000 −675 22,664 17,782 [513] 2017 11,759 −1,962 28,655 37,543 [513] 2018 21,461 −976 29,740 48,817 [513] 2019 24,578 −862 34,309 48,016 [513] 2020 31,536 721 52,148 70,757 [513] 2021 53,823 5,519 62,131 99,290 [513] 2022 81,462 12,556 82,338 127,855 [513] 2023 96,773 14,997 106,618 140,473 [513] Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard (2004–2007) Ze'ev Drori (2007–2008)[514][515] Elon Musk (since October 2008)[516] List of board chairs Elon Musk (2004–2018)[517] Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[516] Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[518] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[519] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[520] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[521] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[519] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[519] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[522] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[523] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[524] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[525] Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[526] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[527] Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[268] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[528] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[529][530] As of May 2023[update], the board members are:[531] Joined Name Titles Independent 2014[532] Robyn Denholm Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra[527] Yes 2004[15] Elon Musk CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX No 2004[533] Kimbal Musk SpaceX board member[534] No 2007[535] Ira Ehrenpreis General Partner at Technology Partners[528] Disputed[518] 2017[528] James Murdoch Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[528] Yes 2018[520] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[520] Yes 2022[536] Joe Gebbia Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[537] Yes 2023[525] J.

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services. Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines. History Main article: History of Tesla, Inc. Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010 Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9][10] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[11] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[12] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[16] Roadster (2005–2009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[17] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18] In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20] In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25] Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[26][27] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[28] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[29] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[30][31] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42 million.[32] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[35] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012 the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[36] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[37] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[38] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[39] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[40] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[41] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[42] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[43] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[44][45] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[46] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[47] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[48] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[49] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55] This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[58] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[59] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[60] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[61] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[62] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[62][63] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[64][65] Deliveries started in March 2020.[66] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81] In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[90] In June 2024, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[91] Automotive products and services \"Tesla electric car\" redirects here.

Model Y Main article: Tesla Model Y Tesla Model Y The Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a single‐motor, rear-wheel drive or a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[64] and deliveries started in March 2020.[66] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[65] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first electric vehicle to claim the title.[97] Tesla Semi Main article: Tesla Semi Tesla Semi prototype The Tesla Semi is a Class 8 semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[98] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[99] As of December 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production.[3] An update in 2024 indicates full production to occur in 2025.[100] Cybertruck Main article: Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Cybertruck The Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km), depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[101][102][103] Announced products Roadster (second generation) Main article: Tesla Roadster (second generation) Tesla Roadster prototype On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[104] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[105] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[105] The base price was set at $200,000.[105] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[106] Tesla next-generation vehicle Main article: Tesla next-generation vehicle The Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[107] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[106] Discontinued Tesla Roadster Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) The original Roadster The original Tesla Roadster[108] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[109] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. Connectivity services Tesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[110] Vehicle servicing Tesla's strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[111][112] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[113] In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[114] Charging services Supercharger network Main article: Tesla Supercharger Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers. Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount. Destination charging location network \"Destination Charger\" in North America Tesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[115] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[116] Insurance services Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[117] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[118] The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[119] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[120] As of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[121] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[119] Energy products Main article: Tesla Energy Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[122] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[123] Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[124][125][126] For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[127][128][129] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[130] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[131][132] Business strategy Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[137] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[138][139] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[140][141] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147] Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151] Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154] On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.[155] On May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges. [156] Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] Batteries Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors As of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[157][158][159] Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[160] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[161] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163] 2170 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product. For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[163] 4680 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163] Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170] Research Tesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[171] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[172] – and sold in 2021.[173] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[174][175] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[176][177] Software Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179] The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181] Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster. Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185] North American Charging Standard Main article: North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186] Autopilot and Full Self-Driving This section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit] Tesla Autopilot in operation Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[187] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision. The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[188][189] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[190] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla's decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[191][192][193][194] Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[195] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[196] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[197] Grohmann Automation,[198] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[199] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] Subsequently, the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots previously required.[200][201] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[202] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[203] Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[204] Facilities See also: List of Tesla factories The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2024[update], the company also operates more than 1,200 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3] Primary facilities operated by Tesla Opened Name City Country Employees Products Ref. 2010 Tesla Fremont Factory Fremont, California United States 22,000 Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y [32][205][206] 2016 Gigafactory Nevada Storey County, Nevada United States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [207][208][209] 2017 Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York United States 1,500 Solar Roof, Supercharger [210][211] 2019 Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger [212][213] 2022 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model Y [214][215][216] 2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United States 12,000 Model Y, Cybertruck [217][218][219] North America Main articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012 Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[220] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[221] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[222] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[223] Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[224] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[32] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[207] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[225] Model 3 drivetrains,[226] and the Tesla Semi.[227] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years,[228] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[227] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[229][230] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[210] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[231] In 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[232] Gigafactory Texas in 2022 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[233] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[234] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[72] Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[235][236] The location opened in 2022. Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building.[237] Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July 2024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election, because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[238] Europe Main articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[239] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[240] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[241] In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[242] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[243] Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[244] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[245] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[246] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[247][248] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[248] Asia Main article: Gigafactory Shanghai Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[249] Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[250] In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[251] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[212] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[252] Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[253] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[254] Partners Panasonic Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[255] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[256] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[257] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[210] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[258][259] In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[260] Other current partners Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[261] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[262] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[263] Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[264] Former partners Daimler The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[265] Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[266][267] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[268] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[269] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[270] Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[271][272] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[273][274] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[275] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[276] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[277][278] Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[32] In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[279] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[280][281] based on components from the Roadster.[282] The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[283] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[284][285] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[286] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[286][160] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[287][288] Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[289] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[290] Lawsuits and controversies Main articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Sexual harassment In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[291] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[292] Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[293] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[294] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[293] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[295] In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[296] Labor disputes See also: Tesla and unions United States In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[297] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[298] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[299] and customers[300] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[301][302] From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[303] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[304] In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[305][306][307] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[308][309] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[310] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[311] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[312] In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[313][314] In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[315][316] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[317] The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[318] Europe In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[319][320][321] Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[322] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[323] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[324] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[325] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[326][327] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[328] From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[329] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[330] A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[331] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[332] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[333][334] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[335] In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[336] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[337][338][339] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[340] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[340] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[341][342] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[343] In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[344] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[344] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[345][346][347] In May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[348] Tesla US dealership disputes See also: Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[145] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[349][350][351] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[352] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[142] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[145] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[113] Intellectual property In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[353] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[354] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[355] Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[356] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[357] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[358] Misappropriation In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[342] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[359] In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[360] Environmental violations In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[361] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[362] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[363] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[364] In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[365] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[366][305] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[367][368] In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". On top of that, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla's facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[369][370][371] Property damage In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[372] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[373] In April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[374][375] Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[376][377] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[378] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[379] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[380] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[381] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[382] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[383] and physically demanding work.[384] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[385] In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[386] In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[387][388] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[389][390] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[391] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[392] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[393] Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[394] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors. COVID-19 pandemic Tesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[395] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[396] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[397][398][399] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[400][401] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[402] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[403] In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[404] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[405] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[406] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[395][407] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[408] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[408] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[408] Right to repair In March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[409][410] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[411][412] While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla's restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[411][412] Criticism Main article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[413][414] A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[415] Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[416] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[417] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[418] Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[419] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[420] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[421] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[422] Tesla's mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[423] Giga New York audit In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[424][425][426] Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[427][428] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[429] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[430] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[431] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[432] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[433] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[434] Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[435][436] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[437] In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[438] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[439][440] In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[441] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[442][443] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[444] Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[445][446] In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[447] On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[448] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[449] In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[450][451] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[451] In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[452] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[453] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[454] In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[455] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[456] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[456][457] Fires See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla Tesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[458] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[459] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[460] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[461] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[462] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[463][464][465] Autopilot crashes See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[466][467] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[468] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[469] According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[470][471] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[472] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[472][473][474] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[475] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[476] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[477] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[478] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[479] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[480] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[481] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[482] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[483] In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[484] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[485] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[486] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[487][488] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[489] In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[490] Phantom braking In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[491] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[492] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[493] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[494] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[495] Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[496] Vehicle sales In 2023, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 19.9%.[497] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[498][499] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[500] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[501] Production and sales by quarter See also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 3 2012 4 1 2 2013 3 4 1 2 2014 3 4 1 2 2015 3 4 1 2 2016 3 4 1 2 2017 3 4 1 2 2018 3 4 1 2 2019 3 4 1 2 2020 3 4 1 2 2021 3 4 1 2 2022 3 4 1 2 2023 3 4 1 2 2024 3 Model S Model X Model S/X Models Other Than 3/Y Model 3 Model 3/Y Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[502] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[503] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[504] Finances Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.Tesla financial performance For the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[505] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[505] Sales by business (2023)[506] Business Sales in billion $ share Automotive 90.7 93.8% Energy Generation and Storage 6.0 6.2% Sales by region (2023)[506] Region Sales in billion $ share United States 45.2 46.7% Other countries 29.8 30.8% China 21.5 22.5% Of the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[505] Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[142]: 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[82] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[507][508] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[509][510] The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[511] The key trends for Tesla are (as at the financial year ending December 31): Year Revenue(US$ m) Net income(US$ m) Total assets(US$ m) Employees Sources 2005 0 −12 8 2006 0 −30 44 70 [512][513] 2007 0.073 −78 34 268 2008 15 −83 52 252 2009 112 −56 130 514 2010 117 −154 386 899 [513] 2011 204 −254 713 1,417 [513] 2012 413 −396 1,114 2,914 [513] 2013 2,013 −74 2,417 5,859 [513] 2014 3,198 −294 5,831 10,161 [513] 2015 4,046 −889 8,068 13,058 [513] 2016 7,000 −675 22,664 17,782 [513] 2017 11,759 −1,962 28,655 37,543 [513] 2018 21,461 −976 29,740 48,817 [513] 2019 24,578 −862 34,309 48,016 [513] 2020 31,536 721 52,148 70,757 [513] 2021 53,823 5,519 62,131 99,290 [513] 2022 81,462 12,556 82,338 127,855 [513] 2023 96,773 14,997 106,618 140,473 [513] Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard (2004–2007) Ze'ev Drori (2007–2008)[514][515] Elon Musk (since October 2008)[516] List of board chairs Elon Musk (2004–2018)[517] Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[516] Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[518] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[519] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[520] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[521] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[519] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[519] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[522] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[523] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[524] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[525] Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[526] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[527] Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[268] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[528] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[529][530] As of May 2023[update], the board members are:[531] Joined Name Titles Independent 2014[532] Robyn Denholm Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra[527] Yes 2004[15] Elon Musk CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX No 2004[533] Kimbal Musk SpaceX board member[534] No 2007[535] Ira Ehrenpreis General Partner at Technology Partners[528] Disputed[518] 2017[528] James Murdoch Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[528] Yes 2018[520] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[520] Yes 2022[536] Joe Gebbia Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[537] Yes 2023[525] J.

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services. Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines.

Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010 Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9][10] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[11] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[12] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[16] Roadster (2005–2009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[17] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18] In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20] In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25] Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[26][27] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[28] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[29] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[30][31] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42 million.[32] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[35] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012 the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[36] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[37] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[38] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[39] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[40] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[41] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[42] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[43] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[44][45] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[46] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[47] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[48] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[49] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55] This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[58] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[59] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[60] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[61] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[62] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[62][63] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[64][65] Deliveries started in March 2020.[66] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81] In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[90] In June 2024, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[91] Automotive products and services \"Tesla electric car\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Nikola Tesla electric car hoax. As of November 2023[update], Tesla offers six vehicle models: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y, Tesla Semi, and Cybertruck.

Available products Model S Main article: Tesla Model S Tesla Model S The Model S is a full-size luxury car with a liftback body style and a dual motor, all-wheel drive layout. Development of the Model S began prior to 2007 and deliveries started in June 2012. The Model S has seen two major design refreshes, first in April 2016 which introduced a new front-end design and again in June 2021 which revised the interior. The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016. More than 250,000 vehicles have been sold as of December 2018[update] (when Tesla merged production numbers for the Model S and Model X). Model X Main article: Tesla Model X Tesla Model X The Model X is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV offered in 5-, 6- and 7-passenger configurations with either a dual- or tri-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating \"falcon-wing\" design. A prototype Model X was first shown in February 2012 and deliveries started in September 2015.[92] The Model X shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S. The vehicle has seen one major design refresh in June 2021 which revised the interior. Model 3 Main article: Tesla Model 3 Tesla Model 3 The Model 3 is a mid-size car with a fastback body style and either a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout or a rear-motor, rear-wheel drive layout.

Model Y Main article: Tesla Model Y Tesla Model Y The Model Y is a mid-size crossover SUV offered in 5- and 7-passenger configurations with a single‐motor, rear-wheel drive or a dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout. The vehicle was designed to be more affordable than the luxury Model X SUV. A prototype Model Y was first shown in March 2019,[64] and deliveries started in March 2020.[66] The Model Y shared around 75 percent of its content with the Model 3.[65] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first electric vehicle to claim the title.[97] Tesla Semi Main article: Tesla Semi Tesla Semi prototype The Tesla Semi is a Class 8 semi-truck by Tesla, Inc. with a tri-motor, rear-wheel drive layout. Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[98] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[99] As of December 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production.[3] An update in 2024 indicates full production to occur in 2025.[100] Cybertruck Main article: Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Cybertruck The Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km), depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[101][102][103] Announced products Roadster (second generation) Main article: Tesla Roadster (second generation) Tesla Roadster prototype On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[104] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[105] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[105] The base price was set at $200,000.[105] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[106] Tesla next-generation vehicle Main article: Tesla next-generation vehicle The Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[107] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[106] Discontinued Tesla Roadster Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) The original Roadster The original Tesla Roadster[108] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[109] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. Connectivity services Tesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[110] Vehicle servicing Tesla's strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[111][112] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[113] In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[114] Charging services Supercharger network Main article: Tesla Supercharger Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers. Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount. Destination charging location network \"Destination Charger\" in North America Tesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[115] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[116] Insurance services Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[117] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[118] The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[119] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[120] As of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[121] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[119] Energy products Main article: Tesla Energy Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[122] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[123] Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[124][125][126] For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[127][128][129] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[130] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[131][132] Business strategy Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[137] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[138][139] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[140][141] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147] Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151] Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154] On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.[155] On May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges. [156] Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] Batteries Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors As of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[157][158][159] Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[160] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[161] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163] 2170 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product. For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[163] 4680 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163] Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170] Research Tesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[171] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[172] – and sold in 2021.[173] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[174][175] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[176][177] Software Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179] The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181] Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster. Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185] North American Charging Standard Main article: North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186] Autopilot and Full Self-Driving This section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit] Tesla Autopilot in operation Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[187] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision. The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[188][189] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[190] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla's decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[191][192][193][194] Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[195] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[196] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[197] Grohmann Automation,[198] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[199] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] Subsequently, the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots previously required.[200][201] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[202] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[203] Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[204] Facilities See also: List of Tesla factories The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2024[update], the company also operates more than 1,200 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3] Primary facilities operated by Tesla Opened Name City Country Employees Products Ref. 2010 Tesla Fremont Factory Fremont, California United States 22,000 Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y [32][205][206] 2016 Gigafactory Nevada Storey County, Nevada United States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [207][208][209] 2017 Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York United States 1,500 Solar Roof, Supercharger [210][211] 2019 Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger [212][213] 2022 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model Y [214][215][216] 2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United States 12,000 Model Y, Cybertruck [217][218][219] North America Main articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012 Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[220] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[221] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[222] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[223] Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[224] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[32] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[207] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[225] Model 3 drivetrains,[226] and the Tesla Semi.[227] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years,[228] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[227] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[229][230] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[210] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[231] In 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[232] Gigafactory Texas in 2022 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[233] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[234] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[72] Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[235][236] The location opened in 2022. Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building.[237] Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July 2024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election, because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[238] Europe Main articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[239] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[240] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[241] In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[242] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[243] Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[244] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[245] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[246] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[247][248] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[248] Asia Main article: Gigafactory Shanghai Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[249] Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[250] In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[251] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[212] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[252] Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[253] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[254] Partners Panasonic Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[255] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[256] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[257] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[210] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[258][259] In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[260] Other current partners Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[261] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[262] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[263] Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[264] Former partners Daimler The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[265] Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[266][267] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[268] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[269] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[270] Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[271][272] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[273][274] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[275] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[276] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[277][278] Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[32] In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[279] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[280][281] based on components from the Roadster.[282] The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[283] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[284][285] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[286] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[286][160] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[287][288] Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[289] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[290] Lawsuits and controversies Main articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Sexual harassment In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[291] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[292] Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[293] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[294] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[293] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[295] In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[296] Labor disputes See also: Tesla and unions United States In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[297] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[298] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[299] and customers[300] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[301][302] From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[303] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[304] In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[305][306][307] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[308][309] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[310] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[311] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[312] In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[313][314] In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[315][316] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[317] The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[318] Europe In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[319][320][321] Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[322] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[323] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[324] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[325] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[326][327] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[328] From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[329] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[330] A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[331] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[332] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[333][334] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[335] In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[336] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[337][338][339] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[340] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[340] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[341][342] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[343] In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[344] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[344] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[345][346][347] In May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[348] Tesla US dealership disputes See also: Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[145] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[349][350][351] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[352] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[142] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[145] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[113] Intellectual property In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[353] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[354] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[355] Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[356] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[357] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[358] Misappropriation In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[342] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[359] In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[360] Environmental violations In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[361] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[362] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[363] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[364] In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[365] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[366][305] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[367][368] In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". On top of that, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla's facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[369][370][371] Property damage In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[372] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[373] In April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[374][375] Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[376][377] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[378] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[379] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[380] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[381] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[382] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[383] and physically demanding work.[384] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[385] In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[386] In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[387][388] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[389][390] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[391] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[392] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[393] Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[394] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors. COVID-19 pandemic Tesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[395] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[396] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[397][398][399] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[400][401] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[402] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[403] In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[404] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[405] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[406] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[395][407] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[408] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[408] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[408] Right to repair In March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[409][410] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[411][412] While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla's restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[411][412] Criticism Main article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[413][414] A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[415] Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[416] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[417] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[418] Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[419] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[420] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[421] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[422] Tesla's mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[423] Giga New York audit In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[424][425][426] Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[427][428] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[429] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[430] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[431] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[432] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[433] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[434] Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[435][436] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[437] In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[438] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[439][440] In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[441] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[442][443] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[444] Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[445][446] In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[447] On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[448] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[449] In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[450][451] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[451] In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[452] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[453] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[454] In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[455] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[456] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[456][457] Fires See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla Tesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[458] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[459] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[460] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[461] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[462] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[463][464][465] Autopilot crashes See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[466][467] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[468] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[469] According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[470][471] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[472] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[472][473][474] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[475] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[476] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[477] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[478] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[479] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[480] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[481] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[482] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[483] In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[484] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[485] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[486] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[487][488] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[489] In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[490] Phantom braking In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[491] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[492] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[493] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[494] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[495] Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[496] Vehicle sales In 2023, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 19.9%.[497] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[498][499] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[500] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[501] Production and sales by quarter See also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 3 2012 4 1 2 2013 3 4 1 2 2014 3 4 1 2 2015 3 4 1 2 2016 3 4 1 2 2017 3 4 1 2 2018 3 4 1 2 2019 3 4 1 2 2020 3 4 1 2 2021 3 4 1 2 2022 3 4 1 2 2023 3 4 1 2 2024 3 Model S Model X Model S/X Models Other Than 3/Y Model 3 Model 3/Y Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[502] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[503] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[504] Finances Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.Tesla financial performance For the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[505] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[505] Sales by business (2023)[506] Business Sales in billion $ share Automotive 90.7 93.8% Energy Generation and Storage 6.0 6.2% Sales by region (2023)[506] Region Sales in billion $ share United States 45.2 46.7% Other countries 29.8 30.8% China 21.5 22.5% Of the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[505] Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[142]: 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[82] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[507][508] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[509][510] The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[511] The key trends for Tesla are (as at the financial year ending December 31): Year Revenue(US$ m) Net income(US$ m) Total assets(US$ m) Employees Sources 2005 0 −12 8 2006 0 −30 44 70 [512][513] 2007 0.073 −78 34 268 2008 15 −83 52 252 2009 112 −56 130 514 2010 117 −154 386 899 [513] 2011 204 −254 713 1,417 [513] 2012 413 −396 1,114 2,914 [513] 2013 2,013 −74 2,417 5,859 [513] 2014 3,198 −294 5,831 10,161 [513] 2015 4,046 −889 8,068 13,058 [513] 2016 7,000 −675 22,664 17,782 [513] 2017 11,759 −1,962 28,655 37,543 [513] 2018 21,461 −976 29,740 48,817 [513] 2019 24,578 −862 34,309 48,016 [513] 2020 31,536 721 52,148 70,757 [513] 2021 53,823 5,519 62,131 99,290 [513] 2022 81,462 12,556 82,338 127,855 [513] 2023 96,773 14,997 106,618 140,473 [513] Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard (2004–2007) Ze'ev Drori (2007–2008)[514][515] Elon Musk (since October 2008)[516] List of board chairs Elon Musk (2004–2018)[517] Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[516] Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[518] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[519] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[520] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[521] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[519] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[519] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[522] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[523] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[524] Former Tesla CTO J. B. Straubel who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023.[525] Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience.[526] The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at Toyota Australia from 1989 to 1996.[527] Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler;[268] CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice;[528] and United Nations Special Envoy on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments Hiromichi Mizuno.[529][530] As of May 2023[update], the board members are:[531] Joined Name Titles Independent 2014[532] Robyn Denholm Chair (since November 2018); former CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra[527] Yes 2004[15] Elon Musk CEO, product architect, former chairman; founder, CEO and CTO of SpaceX No 2004[533] Kimbal Musk SpaceX board member[534] No 2007[535] Ira Ehrenpreis General Partner at Technology Partners[528] Disputed[518] 2017[528] James Murdoch Former CEO of 21st Century Fox[528] Yes 2018[520] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson Global head of Human Resources of Walgreens Boots Alliance[520] Yes 2022[536] Joe Gebbia Co-founder, board member and advisor of Airbnb[537] Yes 2023[525] J.

(/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services. Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7] Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines. History Main article: History of Tesla, Inc. Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a Tesla Roadster, c. 2010 Founding (2003–2004) The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[9][10] They served as chief executive officer and chief financial officer, respectively.[11] Eberhard said that he wanted to build \"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company\", with its core technologies as \"the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor\".[12] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[16] Roadster (2005–2009) Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[17] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[18] In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20] In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25] Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[26][27] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company.[28] In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[29] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[30][31] IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) First deliveries of Model S at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, in June 2012 In May 2010, Tesla purchased the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California from Toyota for $42 million.[32] On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956.[33] The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million.[34] In October 2010, Tesla opened the Tesla Factory to start production of the Model S.[35] In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June 2012 the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan.[36] The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,[37] and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it topped the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013.[38] The Model S was also the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.[39] On July 15, 2013, Tesla became a NASDAQ-100 company.[40] Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called \"hardware version 1\".[41] Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business) battery packs in April 2015.[42] The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling.[43] Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time.[44][45] SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal.[46] The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary.[47] The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.[48] In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business.[49] Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55] This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO. Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500.[58] During 2020, its share price increased 740%,[59] and by December 14, 2020, its market capitalization was more than the next nine largest automakers combined,[60] and it became the sixth most valuable company in the US.[61] Tesla was added to the S&P index on December 21, 2020;[62] it was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added.[62][63] Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y mid-size crossover SUV, based on the Model 3.[64][65] Deliveries started in March 2020.[66] During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81] In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88] Between May 2023 and February 2024, almost all major North America EV manufacturers announced plans to switch to Tesla's North American Charging Standard adapters on their EVs by 2025, which is expected to be a stable source of recurring revenue for Tesla.[89] In April 2024, the company announced it was laying off 10% of its employees.[90] In June 2024, the company moved its incorporation from Delaware to Texas.[91] Automotive products and services \"Tesla electric car\" redirects here.

Tesla claims that the Semi has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km).[98] Two prototype trucks were first shown in November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022.[99] As of December 2023[update], the truck remains in pilot production.[3] An update in 2024 indicates full production to occur in 2025.[100] Cybertruck Main article: Tesla Cybertruck Tesla Cybertruck The Cybertruck is a full-sized pickup truck. First announced in November 2019, pilot production began in July 2023, after being pushed back multiple times, and deliveries began on November 30, 2023. Three models are offered: rear-wheel drive, dual-motor all-wheel drive, and tri-motor all-wheel drive, with EPA range estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km), depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat sheets of unpainted stainless steel earned a notably polarizing reception from media.[101][102][103] Announced products Roadster (second generation) Main article: Tesla Roadster (second generation) Tesla Roadster prototype On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds,[104] and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A \"SpaceX Package\" would include cold-gas thrusters.[105] The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing all-wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.[105] The base price was set at $200,000.[105] Initially scheduled to ship in 2020, the vehicle has been repeatedly delayed. In July 2024, Musk said that the Roadster should enter production in 2025.[106] Tesla next-generation vehicle Main article: Tesla next-generation vehicle The Tesla next-generation vehicle is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third platform for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025.[107] In July 2024, Musk said that the vehicle should be available for delivery in the first half of 2025.[106] Discontinued Tesla Roadster Main article: Tesla Roadster (first generation) The original Roadster The original Tesla Roadster[108] was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis.[109] It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge. Connectivity services Tesla cars come with \"Standard Connectivity\", which provides navigation using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to \"Premium Connectivity\" which adds live traffic and satellite maps to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming.[110] Vehicle servicing Tesla's strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center.[111][112] Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.[113] In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: \"your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,\" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.[114] Charging services Supercharger network Main article: Tesla Supercharger Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current fast chargers. Tesla Supercharger station in Wittenburg, Germany. The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California and Nevada. As of July 2024[update], Tesla operates a network of 6,500 Supercharger stations with nearly 60,000 connectors. The network is primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,650 stations), North America (over 2,550), and Europe (over 1,200). Since 2019 most superchargers deployed have been able to output as much as 250 kilowatts (kW). As of January 2024[update] approximately 68% of chargers have V3 or V4 stalls capable of outputting this amount. Destination charging location network \"Destination Charger\" in North America Tesla also has a network of \"Destination Chargers,\" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing.[115] When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs.[citation needed] One of the largest providers is hotel chain Hilton Worldwide which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025.[116] Insurance services Tesla has offered its own vehicle insurance in the United States since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the American Automobile Association (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles.[117] A study in 2018 based on data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirmed the findings.[118] The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges.[119] In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score.[120] As of January 2023[update], Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.[121] The company also offers insurance for non-Tesla vehicles owned by Tesla owners.[119] Energy products Main article: Tesla Energy Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.[122] In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223 megawatts, a decrease of 36% over 2022.[123] Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the Tesla Solar Roof (a solar shingle system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the Powerwall (a home energy storage device) and the Megapack (a large-scale energy storage system).[124][125][126] For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control.[127][128][129] In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage.[130] For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers.[131][132] Business strategy Robotic manufacturing of the Model S at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.[137] Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores.[138][139] The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers.[140][141] Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147] Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.[149][150][151] Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy.[152] Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly.[153] Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.[154] On April 15, 2024, Tesla secured a deal with Tata Electronics to supply semiconductor chips, marking a significant step in Tesla's expansion into India's automotive market.[155] On May 2, 2024, Tesla announced that it has abandoned its plan for next-generation gigacasting, a cutting-edge manufacturing technique. Initially aiming to revolutionize production and reduce costs, Tesla has now opted for its more proven method of casting vehicle underbodies in three pieces. This strategic shift reflects the company's focus on self-driving vehicles and adjusting to market challenges. [156] Technology Tesla is highly vertically integrated and develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software.[148] Batteries Tesla vehicle chassis used in Model S and X, with the battery visible Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors As of 2023, Tesla uses four different battery cell form factors: 18650, 2170, 4680, and prismatic.[157][158][159] Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers, CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Panasonic, the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries. Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes.[160] Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh.[161] 18650 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163] 2170 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163] For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product. For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a nickel-cobalt-manganese (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China.[163] 4680 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163] Prismatic Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170] Research Tesla invests in lithium-ion battery research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn.[171] Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million[172] – and sold in 2021.[173] It also acquired Hibar Systems.[174][175] Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.[176][177] Software Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179] The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181] Motors Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics. The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster. Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185] North American Charging Standard Main article: North American Charging Standard The North American Charging Standard (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors.[186] Autopilot and Full Self-Driving This section is an excerpt from Tesla Autopilot.[edit] Tesla Autopilot in operation Tesla Autopilot is an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) developed by Tesla that amounts to partial vehicle automation (Level 2 automation, as defined by SAE International). Tesla provides \"Base Autopilot\" on all vehicles, which includes lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control. Owners may purchase or subscribe to Full Self-Driving (FSD) which adds semi-autonomous navigation that responds to traffic lights and stop signs, lane change assistance, self-parking, and the ability to summon the car from a garage or parking spot. The company's stated intent is to offer fully autonomous driving (SAE Level 5) at a future time, acknowledging that technical and regulatory hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[187] The names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are controversial, because vehicles remain at Level 2 automation and are therefore not \"fully self-driving\" and require active driver supervision. The company claims the features reduce accidents caused by driver negligence and fatigue from long-term driving.[188][189] Collisions and deaths involving Tesla cars with Autopilot engaged have drawn the attention of the press and government agencies.[190] Industry observers and academics have criticized Tesla's decision to use untrained consumers to validate beta features as dangerous and irresponsible.[191][192][193][194] Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly made inaccurate predictions for Tesla to achieve Level 5 autonomy within one to three years,[195] most recently predicting the end of 2023.[196] Robotics In preparation for Model 3 production, Tesla heavily invested in robotics and automation for vehicle assembly. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation,[197] Grohmann Automation,[198] Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die.[199] Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] Subsequently, the shifted towards utilizing massive casting machines, known as Giga Presses. These machines streamline production by creating large, single-piece underbodies, leading to reductions in production time, labor costs, factory footprint, and the number of welding robots previously required.[200][201] Critics note that reducing the number of components makes the vehicles harder or more expensive to repair after an accident.[202] The company has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus since 2022. Musk has stated that Optimus leverages the same core software powering Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and has suggested that it could be used within Tesla's factories to mitigate labor shortages through the automation of repetitive tasks.[203] Glass In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.[204] Facilities See also: List of Tesla factories The company operates seven large factories and about a dozen smaller factories around the world. As of 2024[update], the company also operates more than 1,200 retail stores, galleries, service, delivery and body shop locations globally.[3] Primary facilities operated by Tesla Opened Name City Country Employees Products Ref. 2010 Tesla Fremont Factory Fremont, California United States 22,000 Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y [32][205][206] 2016 Gigafactory Nevada Storey County, Nevada United States 7,000 Batteries, Powerwall, Semi [207][208][209] 2017 Gigafactory New York Buffalo, New York United States 1,500 Solar Roof, Supercharger [210][211] 2019 Gigafactory Shanghai Shanghai China 20,000 Model 3, Model Y, Supercharger [212][213] 2022 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Grünheide Germany 10,000 Model Y [214][215][216] 2022 Gigafactory Texas Austin, Texas United States 12,000 Model Y, Cybertruck [217][218][219] North America Main articles: Tesla Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory New York, Gigafactory Texas, and Gigafactory Mexico New Tesla Model S cars at the Tesla Fremont Factory in 2012 Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California in 2003.[220] In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park, California. The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company showroom as a retail store.[221] Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year.[222] In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.[223] Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984.[224] The joint venture ended when GM entered bankruptcy in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount.[32] Gigafactory Nevada in 2019 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces the Powerwall,[207] battery cells in partnership with Panasonic,[225] Model 3 drivetrains,[226] and the Tesla Semi.[227] The factory received substantial subsidies (abatements and credits) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years,[228] later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity.[227] As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of Gigafactory New York in Buffalo on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the Buffalo Billion program.[229][230] In 2017, the factory started production of the Tesla Solar Roof,[210] but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding.[231] In 2018, Tesla assembled tension fabric buildings at the Fremont plant to meet production goals of 5,000 cars produced a month. The structure was assembled in two weeks and measured 53 feet high, 150 feet wide, and 900 feet long.[232] Gigafactory Texas in 2022 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as Gigafactory Texas.[233] Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin.[234] However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event.[72] Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California, in 2021 to build the \"Megafactory\" to manufacture the Megapack, the company's large scale energy storage product.[235][236] The location opened in 2022. Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard, located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building.[237] Tesla has announced plans to open a Gigafactory Mexico, the company's sixth Gigafactory, near Monterrey, Mexico. However, as of July 2024[update], the company has placed construction on hold until after the 2024 United States presidential election, because former President Trump has pledged to add tariffs on cars made in Mexico.[238] Europe Main articles: Tesla facilities in Tilburg and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London.[239] Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands,[240] part of a group of Tesla facilities in Tilburg, including the company's European Distribution Centre.[241] In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.[242] After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.[243] Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016.[244] Several countries campaigned to be the host,[245] and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019.[246] On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg[247][248] opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.[248] Asia Main article: Gigafactory Shanghai Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia[249] Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010.[250] In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States.[251] The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Gigafactory Shanghai in October 2019.[212] In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales.[252] Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country.[253] The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in Pune starting in October 2023.[254] Partners Panasonic Panasonic Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive JB Straubel with lithium-ion cells In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles.[255] Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles.[256] In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.[257] Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York.[210] The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.[258][259] In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.[260] Other current partners Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years,[261] specifically to supply \"spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit\".[262] In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.[263] Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.[264] Former partners Daimler The Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive used a Tesla-supplied battery pack.[265] Daimler and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million.[266][267] As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat.[268] On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company owned by the government of Abu Dhabi.[269] In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million.[270] Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks in 2010.[271][272] The company also built electric-powertrain components for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.[273][274] Tesla produced and co-developed the Mercedes-Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017.[275] The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).[276] Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ) lithium-ion battery from Tesla.[277][278] Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV, which used a Tesla-supplied battery and powertrain components In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.[32] In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV.[279] The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components[280][281] based on components from the Roadster.[282] The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012).[283] The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.[284][285] According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was \"marred by clashes between engineers\".[286] Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire.[286][160] On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.[287][288] Mobileye Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014.[289] Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing \"disagreements about how the technology was deployed.\"[290] Lawsuits and controversies Main articles: List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc. and Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Sexual harassment In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory.[291] They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. \"I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,\" Brooks told The Washington Post. \"That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.\" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.[292] Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants.[293] Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to \"T.IT.S\", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment.[294] \"What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,\" said attorney David A. Lowe.[293] In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of \"a neutral, third-party expert\" and concluded her complaints were unmerited.[295] In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration.[296] Labor disputes See also: Tesla and unions United States In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) regarding customer repairs[297] and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta.[298] Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees[299] and customers[300] to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.[301][302] From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined.[303] An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla \"failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports\" to downplay the extent of injuries.[304] In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders.[305][306][307] Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez[308][309] and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen.[310] In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration.[311] In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen \"has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing\".[312] In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.[313][314] In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.[315][316] Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision.[317] The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging \"a pattern of racial harassment and bias\" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023,[update] the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation.[318] Europe In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union IF Metall against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via solidarity strikes to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations.[319][320][321] Fraud allegations There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting standards.[322] Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits.[323] In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance.[324] In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting.[325] In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of \"significant fraud\",[326][327] and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was \"beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist.\"[328] From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers.[329] Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was \"gaming\" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.[330] A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose \"troubling facts\" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition.[331] The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant.[332] In April 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in favor of Musk,[333][334] and its ruling was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court in June 2023.[335] In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\"[336] The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false.[337][338][339] Musk settled fraud charges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board.[340] Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each.[340] A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.[341][342] In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit.[343] In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures.[344] Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet.[344] A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019.[345][346][347] In May 2024, Reuters reported that US federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company committed securities or wire fraud by \"misleading investors and consumers\" about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.[348] Tesla US dealership disputes See also: Tesla US dealership disputes Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called \"galleries\" which \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142] This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers.[145] The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price.[349][350][351] Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars.[352] The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles,[142] because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales.[145] Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.[113] Intellectual property In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account.[353] Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a \"willful and malicious thief\" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer.[354] The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.[355] Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as XPeng and Zoox;[356] for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account;[357] Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla.[358] Misappropriation In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan.[342] Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020.[359] In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020.[360] Environmental violations In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017.[361] In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District;[362] the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019.[363] Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.[364] In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory.[365] After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory.[366][305] The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.[367][368] In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay US$1.5 million and admit to acting \"intentionally\" and \"negligent\". On top of that, Tesla also agreed to train its employees on hazardous waste disposal and to have 10 percent of Tesla's facilities audited for waste disposal for the next 5 years.[369][370][371] Property damage In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's \"negligent installation and maintenance\" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012.[372] Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[373] In April 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit were awarded 136,000 Norwegian kroner each ($16,000).[374][375] Racism Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination,[376][377] with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as \"a hotbed of racist behavior\".[378] As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American.[379] A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a \"very racist place\".[380] Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire.[381] Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and \"allows a racist environment in its factories.\"[382] According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial[383] and physically demanding work.[384] The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for \"discriminating against its Black workers.\"[385] In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n-word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.[386] In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016.[387][388] In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never \"really\" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner.[389][390] In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million.[391] Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.[392] In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial.[393] Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements.[394] Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors. COVID-19 pandemic Tesla's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders \"fascist\".[395] He had also called the public's response to the pandemic \"dumb\" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April.[396] In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th.[397][398][399] Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen.[400][401] In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe,[402] however some employees still expressed concern for their health.[403] In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work.[404] But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory.[405] Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll.[406] COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%).[395][407] In China, Tesla had what one executive described as \"not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort.\"[408] Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds.[408] Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S.–Chinese relations, the Persecution of Uyghurs in China, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.[408] Right to repair In March 2023, a class action antitrust lawsuit was filed against Tesla by Virginia M. Lambrix in San Francisco, California, alleging that the company unlawfully monopolized the market for maintenance and repair of its vehicles in violation of the Sherman Act and California antitrust law, as a result of which owners were \"forced to pay supracompetitive prices and suffer exorbitant wait times\" for maintenance services and repair parts.[409][410] The lawsuit was later combined with four other similar suits.[411][412] While six out of eight alleged antitrust violations were dismissed, in June 2024 US District Judge Trina Thompson allowed two claims to proceed, including alleged violations of California’s Cartwright Act and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), with the court finding evidence of a repairs monopoly in Tesla's designing of its vehicles to require diagnostic and software updates that only the company could provide, and evidence of a parts monopoly in Tesla's restricting original equipment manufacturers from selling \"to anyone other than Tesla.\"[411][412] Criticism Main article: Criticism of Tesla, Inc. Data privacy Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns.[413][414] A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared \"highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras\" with one another.[415] Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in \"serious data protection lapse[s].\"[416] The data Krupski retrieved included \"information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries\" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to.[417] As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws.[418] Short sellers TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to \"shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock.\"[419] In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets.[420] By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher.[421] Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.[422] Tesla's mission According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that \"the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.\"[423] Giga New York audit In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state.[424][425][426] Delays Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products.[427][428] By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections.[429] In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December.[430] A month later, he revised that target to \"sometime in March\" 2018.[431] Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well.[432] Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar-powered have also lagged projections.[433] Musk responded in late 2018: \"punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?\"[434] Vehicle product issues Recalls On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and \"prevent the vehicles from moving\".[435][436] On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion-susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use \"increased force\" to control the vehicle.[437] In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues.[438] Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding \"front suspension safety issues\", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the \"whompy wheel\" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.[439][440] In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years.[441] The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features.[442][443] The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.[444] Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of \"body mouldings problems\".[445][446] In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.[447] On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion.[448] After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.[449] In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury.[450][451] In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix.[451] In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars.[452] NHTSA found that FSD caused \"unreasonable risk\" when used on city streets.[453] In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats.[454] In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the NHTSA,[455] Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total.[456] The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained \"continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation\" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy.[456][457] Fires See also: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla Tesla customers have reported the company as being \"slow\" to address how their cars can ignite.[458] In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object.[459] As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage.[460] In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs.[461] All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield.[462] In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause \"non-crash\" fires.[463][464][465] Autopilot crashes See also: List of Tesla Autopilot crashes A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot.[466][467] The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend.[468] In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.[469] According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities.[470][471] In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident[472] and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles.[472][473][474] In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night.[475] In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update.[476] In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to \"explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision.\"[477] A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path,[478] but there has been controversy over its conclusions.[479] Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.[480] Software hacking In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system.[481] The hack required the researchers to physically access the car.[482] Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.[483] In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus (CAN bus) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot.[484] This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public.[485] Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.[486] In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security.[487][488] Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.[489] In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.[490] Phantom braking In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in \"phantom braking\" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021.[491] In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.[492] In May 2023, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants.[493] The 100 gigabytes of data \"contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration\" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot.[494] Dutch authorities responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations.[495] Driving range performance Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates.[496] Vehicle sales In 2023, Tesla ranked as the world's best-selling battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 19.9%.[497] Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries of 1.8 million units, up 38% from 2022.[498][499] In March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car.[500] In Q4 2023, BYD took over the top spot for EVs shipped, but Tesla regained the title in Q1 2024.[501] Production and sales by quarter See also: History of Tesla, Inc. § Timeline of production and sales 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 500,000 3 2012 4 1 2 2013 3 4 1 2 2014 3 4 1 2 2015 3 4 1 2 2016 3 4 1 2 2017 3 4 1 2 2018 3 4 1 2 2019 3 4 1 2 2020 3 4 1 2 2021 3 4 1 2 2022 3 4 1 2 2023 3 4 1 2 2024 3 Model S Model X Model S/X Models Other Than 3/Y Model 3 Model 3/Y Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[502] In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.[503] In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla.[504] Finances Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.Tesla financial performance For the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion.[505] The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year.[505] Sales by business (2023)[506] Business Sales in billion $ share Automotive 90.7 93.8% Energy Generation and Storage 6.0 6.2% Sales by region (2023)[506] Region Sales in billion $ share United States 45.2 46.7% Other countries 29.8 30.8% China 21.5 22.5% Of the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters.[505] Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020.[142]: 31 In February 2021, a 10-K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.[82] Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals.[507][508] Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.[509][510] The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.[511] The key trends for Tesla are (as at the financial year ending December 31): Year Revenue(US$ m) Net income(US$ m) Total assets(US$ m) Employees Sources 2005 0 −12 8 2006 0 −30 44 70 [512][513] 2007 0.073 −78 34 268 2008 15 −83 52 252 2009 112 −56 130 514 2010 117 −154 386 899 [513] 2011 204 −254 713 1,417 [513] 2012 413 −396 1,114 2,914 [513] 2013 2,013 −74 2,417 5,859 [513] 2014 3,198 −294 5,831 10,161 [513] 2015 4,046 −889 8,068 13,058 [513] 2016 7,000 −675 22,664 17,782 [513] 2017 11,759 −1,962 28,655 37,543 [513] 2018 21,461 −976 29,740 48,817 [513] 2019 24,578 −862 34,309 48,016 [513] 2020 31,536 721 52,148 70,757 [513] 2021 53,823 5,519 62,131 99,290 [513] 2022 81,462 12,556 82,338 127,855 [513] 2023 96,773 14,997 106,618 140,473 [513] Corporate affairs List of chief executives Martin Eberhard (2004–2007) Ze'ev Drori (2007–2008)[514][515] Elon Musk (since October 2008)[516] List of board chairs Elon Musk (2004–2018)[517] Robyn Denholm (since November 2018)[516] Board of directors Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board \"who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk\".[518] The investors wrote that \"five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement.\"[519] Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX;[520] Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX.[521] The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink.[519] At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors \"should buy Ford stock\" because \"their governance is amazing.\"[519] Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members;[522] Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018.[523] Ellison stepped down in August 2022.[524] Former Tesla CTO J. B.

      "Tesla was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk joined as Tesla's largest shareholder; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023. In June 2021 the Model 3 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] In 2023, the Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally.[7]\n",

      "Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. In October 2021, Tesla temporarily became a trillion-dollar company, the seventh U.S. company to do so. In 2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.[8] As of March 2024[update], it is the world's most valuable automaker. Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk including overpromising on the company's driving assist technology and product release timelines.\n",

      "Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later.[9] In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2023) in series A funding, including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2023) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.[13][14][11] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.[15]\n",

      "\n",
      "In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[19][14] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[20] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[20]\n",

      "In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[21] Eberhard then took the title of \"President of Technology\" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[22] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President.[23] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[23] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[24] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[25]\n",

      "\n",
      "Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. The Model 3 was less expensive than Tesla's previous three vehicles, and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations.[50] In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3, but the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles.[51] This led to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company described as \"production hell.\"[52][53] By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 became the world's best-selling electric car from 2018 to 2021.[54][55]\n",
      "\n",
      "This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most shorted companies in the stock market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private.[56][57] The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC, which would force Musk to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain the CEO.\n",

      "\n",
      "During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of Gigafactory Shanghai started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture).[67] Its first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking.[68] Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg broke ground in February 2020,[69] and its production of the Model Y began in March 2022.[70] Gigafactory Texas broke ground in June 2020,[71] its production of the Model Y began in April 2022,[72] and it produced the first Cybertruck in November 2023.[73] In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a Gigafactory Mexico to open in 2025.[74]\n",

      "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and Alameda county COVID restrictions.[75] When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020.[76] The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit.[77] After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas.[78][79] However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022,[80] and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by Hewlett Packard.[81]\n",

      "In early 2021, Tesla became a major investor in bitcoin, acquiring $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency,[82] and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases.[83] However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy.[84] After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%.[85] Tesla CEO Elon Musk later noted that Tesla would resume Bitcoin payments if there was confirmation of at least 50% clean energy usage by Bitcoin miners. Despite later reaching this milestone, Tesla did not return to accepting Bitcoin.[86][87] By July 2022 Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability.[88]\n",

      "At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive.[133] In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars.[18][134] Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market,[135][136] selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter.

In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says \"educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles.\"[142][143] In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries.[144] These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas,[139] instead of near other auto dealerships.[145][146][147]\n",

      "Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical, lithium-ion battery cells. When it built the first generation Roadster, it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an intumescent fire prevention chemical.[162] However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan.[163]\n",
      "\n",
      "The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles.[163]\n",
      "\n",
      "For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada.[164] In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there.[165] Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.\n",

      "Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.[166][167] Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas.[163]\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.[163] The prismatic cells are a lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP or LiFePO4) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce.[168] Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022[update], nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells.[169] Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product.[170]\n",

      "Tesla uses over-the-air updates to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems.[178] This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level.[179]\n",
      "\n",
      "The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats.[180] Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features.[181]\n",

      "Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors: an induction motor, and an internal permanent magnet (IPM) motor with synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The older design is a three-phase four-pole alternating current induction motor (also called an asynchronous motor) with a copper rotor (which inspired the Tesla logo).[182] These motors use electromagnetic induction, by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017, Tesla has also been building IPM-SynRM motors. These motors uses an iron rotor, with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to counter-electromotive forces. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron’s reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the stator if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.[183][184] The IPM-SynRM motor is currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi.[185]\n",
