At the event, billed \"We, Robot,\" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides.However, investors have so far not shared his enthusiasm - Tesla\\'s share price fell after markets opened in the US on Friday morning.The value of its stock was down more than eight percent, trading at around $219, at 11:45 Eastern Time (16:45 BST).Meanwhile shares in ride-hailing rivals Uber and Lyft - which have their own autonomous ambitions - were each trading up to 10% higher.Questions are being asked about Mr Musk\\'s prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time \"before 2027\", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines.\"I tend to be optimistic with time frames,\" he quipped during the event.He said the Cybercab - which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (£23,000).However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is.\"It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,\" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester.\"Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn\\'t seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,\" he added.Safety concernsMr Musk also said he expected to see \"fully autonomous unsupervised\" technology available in Tesla\\'s Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year \"with permission where ever regulators approve it.\"But that approval is far from guaranteed.\"It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,\" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University.Tesla\\'s self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors\\' vehicles.By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles.But the research community \"is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,\" Mr Samaranayake said.Playing catch upThe cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally been due for release in August.This summer, in a post on X , formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important.Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.How robotaxis are dividing San FranciscoRobotaxi tech improves but can they make money?Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened.Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday\\'s event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla\\'s humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees.Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a \"Robovan\" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time.The sleek shuttle \"could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,\" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.Tesla/Reuters\"Can you imagine going down the streets and you see this coming towards you? That would be sick,\" Musk told attendees as Tesla\\'s Robovan rolled into Thursday\\'s event.Another analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead.\"Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,\" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out.\"Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,\" Caldwell added.State of the robotaxi marketThe deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiary Cruise being suspended in San Francisco after a pedestrian was knocked down.But the sector continues to expand. Waymo said in early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company\\'s technology.Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers.It announced a multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August.Chinese tech company Baidu is also reportedly looking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China - where the vehicles are active in several cities.Additional reporting by Liv McMahonTesla surprises with better than expected car salesHave the wheels come off for Tesla?Elon MuskInternational BusinessTeslaRelatedElon Musk\\'s Starship booster captured in world first4 days agoScience & EnvironmentWatch astonishing moment Starship booster caught in mid-air \\'chopsticks manoeuvre\\'4 days agoScience & EnvironmentWhat\\'s next for Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX Starship rocket?5 days agoUS & CanadaMore1 hr ago\\'It\\'s our moonshot\\': Why scientists are drilling into volcanosIn Iceland scientists plan to drill down to magma to understand it and use it for energy production.1 hr agoEurope3 hrs agoNetflix hikes prices in some countries as growth fadesNetflix announces some price hikes, as growth from password sharing crackdown starts to fade. 3 hrs ago21 hrs agoUS \\'click to cancel\\' rule to ban subscription trapsNew rule requires businesses to make subscribing and cancelling subscriptions equally simple. 21 hrs agoBusiness1 day agoHow does WhatsApp make money?

Oct 11, 2024, 2:59 AM UTCShare this storyThreads Image: TeslaTesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a new electric vehicle dedicated to self-driving, a possible milestone after years of false promises and blown deadlines. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production. The design was futuristic, with doors that open upward like butterfly wings and a small cabin with only enough space for two passengers. There was no steering wheel or pedals, nor was there a plug — Musk said the vehicle charges inductively to regain power wirelessly. Musk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehiclesMusk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10–20 times safer than human-driven vehicles and could cost as little as 20 cents per mile, compared to the $1 per mile for city buses. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab entering production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. Additionally, Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000–$30,000 and is capable of performing various tasks.“This is a very big deal,” Musk said. “It’ll save lives, a lot of lives, and prevent injuries.”RelatedTesla’s “We, Robot” robotaxi event: the biggest news and announcementsMusk revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of nonpublic roads for the demonstration. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn’t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature. Musk is attempting to steer Tesla away from its core business of making and selling EVs toward one that produces robots and AI. Tesla’s market cap is equal to almost all the other global automaker’s values combined. Much of the company’s stock price is based on Musk’s yearslong promise to solve autonomy by releasing a truly revolutionary vehicle that can drive itself anywhere it wants. Whether Tesla’s robotaxi will accomplish that steep task is anyone’s guess. Musk has a reputation for defying the odds, but AV experts have routinely questioned Tesla’s approach to the technology, especially with regard to the company’s aggressive push for Level 2 advanced driver-assist systems like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised). PreviousNext1/11PreviousNext1/11Those features, which are not autonomous and require a driver to stay vigilant at all times, can be impressive but have also been known to make critical errors. Earlier this year, a 28-year-old motorcyclist was killed by a Tesla driver allegedly using FSD. Tesla has been forced to recall both of its driver-assist systems in the face of increased government scrutiny over the company’s autonomy claims.But Musk has a track record of coming from behind to pull off impossible victories. The Model 3 production and the early success of the Cybertruck are two recent examples of Musk defying expectations. “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car”During the event, Musk pitched the idea of autonomous cars primarily as time-savers. “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car,” he said, “and the time they will get back that they can now spend on their books or watching a movie or doing work or whatever.”Still, Tesla is lagging behind companies like Waymo and Cruise, both of which have racked up millions of miles of on-road testing with their driverless vehicles. To be sure, robotaxis have had a bumpy rollout, with numerous incidents of blocked vehicles, traffic jams, and even a handful of injuries. Federal safety regulators are probing several major players to discern whether the technology powering these vehicles is safe or should be recalled. The families of Tesla drivers who have been killed in crashes involving Autopilot have sued the company for wrongful death. And Musk’s tenure as head of X, formerly Twitter, has alienated many of Tesla’s progressive-leaning customers, who have watched in horror as he promotes right-wing conspiracy theories on the platform.

There was no steering wheel or pedals, nor was there a plug — Musk said the vehicle charges inductively to regain power wirelessly. Musk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehiclesMusk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10–20 times safer than human-driven vehicles and could cost as little as 20 cents per mile, compared to the $1 per mile for city buses. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab entering production by 2026 — although he said it could be as late as 2027. Additionally, Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000–$30,000 and is capable of performing various tasks.“This is a very big deal,” Musk said. “It’ll save lives, a lot of lives, and prevent injuries.”RelatedTesla’s “We, Robot” robotaxi event: the biggest news and announcementsMusk revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla’s “We, Robot” event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of nonpublic roads for the demonstration. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn’t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature. Musk is attempting to steer Tesla away from its core business of making and selling EVs toward one that produces robots and AI. Tesla’s market cap is equal to almost all the other global automaker’s values combined. Much of the company’s stock price is based on Musk’s yearslong promise to solve autonomy by releasing a truly revolutionary vehicle that can drive itself anywhere it wants. Whether Tesla’s robotaxi will accomplish that steep task is anyone’s guess. Musk has a reputation for defying the odds, but AV experts have routinely questioned Tesla’s approach to the technology, especially with regard to the company’s aggressive push for Level 2 advanced driver-assist systems like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised). PreviousNext1/11PreviousNext1/11Those features, which are not autonomous and require a driver to stay vigilant at all times, can be impressive but have also been known to make critical errors. Earlier this year, a 28-year-old motorcyclist was killed by a Tesla driver allegedly using FSD. Tesla has been forced to recall both of its driver-assist systems in the face of increased government scrutiny over the company’s autonomy claims.But Musk has a track record of coming from behind to pull off impossible victories. The Model 3 production and the early success of the Cybertruck are two recent examples of Musk defying expectations. “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car”During the event, Musk pitched the idea of autonomous cars primarily as time-savers. “Think about the cumulative time that people spend in a car,” he said, “and the time they will get back that they can now spend on their books or watching a movie or doing work or whatever.”Still, Tesla is lagging behind companies like Waymo and Cruise, both of which have racked up millions of miles of on-road testing with their driverless vehicles. To be sure, robotaxis have had a bumpy rollout, with numerous incidents of blocked vehicles, traffic jams, and even a handful of injuries. Federal safety regulators are probing several major players to discern whether the technology powering these vehicles is safe or should be recalled. The families of Tesla drivers who have been killed in crashes involving Autopilot have sued the company for wrongful death. And Musk’s tenure as head of X, formerly Twitter, has alienated many of Tesla’s progressive-leaning customers, who have watched in horror as he promotes right-wing conspiracy theories on the platform.
