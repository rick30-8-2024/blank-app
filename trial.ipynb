To the Native Americans it was a source not only of nourishment, but of medicine and building material. The Aztecs offered the golden blossoms to their god of war, and then to the Spanish conquistadors as a symbol of alliance. The Spanish took the flower to Europe, and from there it was taken to Russia, where it was cultivated for food and oil. It was not until the 19th century that interest in the sunflower returned to mainstream North American society. Since then, it has been a commercial crop, a garden favorite, and beloved of artists like Oscar Wilde, Paul Gauguin, and Vincent Van Gogh. Sunflowers are still grown today in Claude Monet's garden at Giverny. how and when to plant sunflower seeds To grow your own sunflowers, plant seeds in late spring or early summer. Sunflowers prefer loose, well-drained soil, and need six to eight hours of full sunlight each day. Succession planting will ensure that new plants are always blooming. Water established sunflower plants heavily once a week. Taller plants may require supports in order to stay upright. Onions can help repel pests that might feed on sunflowers, while sunflowers distract aphids from tomato plants (and the tomatoes attract pollinators to the sunflower). Heavy-stemmed varieties like Eden Brothers' Black Russian Sunflower Seeds can offer support to vining plants. Plant Eden Brothers' Autumn Beauty Sunflower Seeds or Skyscraper Sunflower Seeds along fence lines for a splash of color or a little privacy, or add Maximillian Sunflower Seeds and Ox Eye Sunflower Seeds to prairie and wildflower gardens. Whatever variety you choose, these long treasured beauties are sure to be a hit! harvesting sunflower seeds and blooms Sunflowers can be cut for arrangements as soon as blossoms have fully opened. To harvest seeds, allow the sunflower to remain on the stalk until the petals have dropped off and the seed head has dried completely. Seeds can then be easily removed by hand, or complete seed heads can be tied to fences and posts or left in place as winter forage for birds and squirrels.

This iconic, versatile flower known for its big, bright blooms comes in a variety of types, heights, and colors—and is a favorite among pollinators. There's a sunflower for every type of garden, with some being compact enough to fit snugly into pots or garden beds, while others can grow to heights exceeding 10 feet tall! Many varieties of sunflowers, especially those with multiple branches, are ideal for long-lasting bouquets. Before they're cut, though, sunflowers tend to track or follow the sun's position throughout the day, which is how they acquired their name.Sunflowers are not picky about soil and, of course, they need tons of sun. Give them at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. You can plant them in rows or beds, with the taller types in the back. If you have rodents such as chipmunks in your garden, you may need to protect the seeds and seedlings by making a tiny cage of chicken wire, which the stems can grow through. Otherwise, you may find the plants chewed up by your hungry garden visitors! For types with edible seeds, such as Mammoth, harvest your sunflowers when the heads droop forward, the petals drop, and the seeds look plump.If you're planning on growing your favorite types of sunflowers, you might also want to check out how to grow mums to get ready for fall!For more fabulous flower ideas: How to Grow and Care for HydrangeasThe Best Annual Flowers for a Colorful Garden These Colorful Flowers Will Attract Hummingbirds to Your Yard 1Mammoth SunflowerSteven Puetzer//Getty ImagesLike the prehistoric wooly animal of the same name, Mammoth sunflowers are named for their large size, growing up to 12 feet tall with flowers that are 10 inches wide.
